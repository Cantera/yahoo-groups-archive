I&#39;ve already made\ns=\r\nome experiences in converting CK-Mechanisms with ck2cti and importing\nthem =\r\nwith importphase.\nAs I wantet to create an own mechanism combining those fo=\r\nr isooctane\nand nheptane (from LLNI) and for Toluene (from Massachusetts In=\r\nstitute\nof Technology Department of Chemical Engineering,\nhttp://web.mit.ed=\r\nu/anish/www/MITcomb.html).\nAfter removing those reactions, which where iden=\r\ntified by ck2ctml to\nbe undefined duplicated I tried to load the mechanism =\r\nusing\nimportphase. There have been some more reactions with &#39;M&#39; or in\ndiffe=\r\nrent order, which still have been undefined duplicated. I\ncommented them, t=\r\noo.\n\nNow MATLAB seems to hang up, because there aren&#39;t any error messages,\n=\r\nbut nothing happens when I&#39;m trying to import the Phase:\n\nck2cti(&#39;prf_2d_me=\r\nch.txt&#39;,&#39;prf_2d_therm.txt&#39;) % works\ngas=3DimportPhase(&#39;prf_2d_mech.cti&#39;); %=\r\n PC hangs up :-(\n\nDo you have any suggestions to fix the problem??? Thanks =\r\na lot.\n\nBy the way: \nIs it able to disabe the warnings for incontinuities o=\r\nf thermodynamic\nproperties at the middle of the temperatur-interval.\nAnd:\nD=\r\no you know any links for more mechanisms concerning petrol combustion.\n\nTha=\r\nnk you very much\n\n\n"}}
