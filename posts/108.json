Other configurations may also work. The Cantera Python interface\nworks fine with the version of Python that comes preinstalled with OS\nX 10.2, provided you first install the &#39;Numeric&#39; package. \n\nFor some reason, the Python that Apple distributes does not include\nTk, so MixMaster can&#39;t be used. But you can get a version of Python\nfrom Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net) that includes Tk, and\nMixMaster works with this version with no problem. (To view reaction\npath diagrams, you also need to get Graphviz. See \nhttp://www.phil.uu.nl/~js/graphviz/)\n\nThe Matlab toolbox does not currently work on the Mac. It looks like\nit will require some rewriting to port the MEX files. \n\nPlease let me know if you run into any problems building Cantera on a\nMac, or if you have suggestions.\n\nDG\n\n\n"}}
