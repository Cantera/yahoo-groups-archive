Using the Matlab version of Cantera 1.6.0\nunder Red Hat Linux Enterprise edition with kernel 2.6.9 and GCC 3.4.3\nand Matlab 7.0.0 on a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 Xeon.  I am only a Linux user,\nand not a developer, so most of the error messages appear mysterious\nto me.\n\nFollowing the instructions, I downloaded Cantera and compiled and\ninstalled it on July 6.  I ran the self-test at that time.  Now I wish\nto test the Matlab part of Cantera.  So I navigate in Matlab to\n~/cantera-1.6.0/Cantera/matlab/cantera/examples.  Then I open the file\nrun_examples.m in that subdirectory, and attempt to run it in the\nMatlab interpreter.  I get the error message pasted to the end of this\npost.  The problem appears related to the version of GCC used to\ncompile (?) and obtain the ctmethods.mexglx file.  I searched the\narchives of this user group for the string &quot;GCC&quot; and I noticed a\nthread begun by Michele V. who also had a problem with this file, but\nher problem appears to differ from mine in the details.  In my case,\nthe file exists on the disk in the location specified and has a file\nsize of 2581107 bytes.\n\nAnyone have any insight into or prior experience with this problem?\n\nAnanda Himansu\n\n\nUnable to load mex file:\n/ODIN_local_backup/fshiman/cantera-1.6.0/Cantera/matlab/cantera/ctmethods.mexglx.\n/r/workstations/products/matlab/matlab7.1/bin/glnx86/../../sys/os/glnx86/libgcc_s.so.1:\nversion `GCC_3.3&#39; not found (required by /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6)\n???
