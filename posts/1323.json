We need\nto be =\r\nable to access the sixth thermodynamic coefficient of the lower\ntemperature=\r\n fit for a given component.  This value is altered in our\ncode to change th=\r\ne reference enthalpy value for a given ingredient. \nIn our case (in which w=\r\ne are modeling solid rocket propellants) the\nenthalpy reference value somet=\r\nimes needs to be altered to take into\naccount an enthalpy change associated=\r\n with the addition of a\nparticular type of curative in a given amount.  We =\r\nhave found it is\neasier to change this value on the fly rather than to chan=\r\nge the input\nvalues in the mechanism file.  I was curious if there is curre=\r\nntly any\nway to access these values from within Cantera.  If not, is there =\r\nsome\nway to get this built in?  We need to be able to change the value of\nt=\r\nhis coefficient, and not just get its value.  Thanks.\n\nDan Smyth\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
