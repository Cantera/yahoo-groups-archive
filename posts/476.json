In your cti file, you supplied a name\nfor the ideal_gas phase\ni.e.:\n\nideal_gas(name = &quot;gri30&quot;,\n          elements = .....\n\nThis names gets translated into an id for an xml phase\nelement, i.e., in your xml file there is a line like:\n\n &lt;phase, dim = &quot;3&quot;, id = &quot;gri30&quot;&gt;\n  ....\n  &lt;&#92;phase&gt;\n\nAnd, when you create the IdealGasMix object in c++ or python, the\nsecond argument in your constructor should be the name of the phase \n(the first argument is the file name):\n\nIdealGasMix g(&quot;gri30.cti&quot;, &quot;gri30&quot;);\n\nLooking at the .h file, the second argument is formally an optional\nargument.\nHowever, in reality, it&#39;s required by the underlying code to be \ncorrectly specified.\n\nSo, this is an inconsistency in Cantera&#39;s API, which needs to be \naddressed, and it&#39;s also an example of an uninformative original \nerror message. I&#39;ll work to get both remedied. \n\nBut, the immediate fix is to supply the correct second argument when\nyou create the IdealGasMix object.\n\nBest wishes,\nHarry Moffat\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: johnny374z [mailto:akm162@...]\nSent: Tuesday, August 17, 2004 8:48 AM\nTo: cantera@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [cantera] Input File error\n\n\nThanks to everyone who helped me out with my previous problems and \nbugs.  However, as always, new bugs have popped up.  This one seems \nto concern my input files.  I have created a custom input file, and \nsuccessfully converted it to .cti format and .xml format.  There \nappear to be no errors at all in these files.  However when I try to \ncreate an IdealGasMix in C++, I get this error: \n************************************************\n                Cantera Error!                  \n************************************************\n\n\nProcedure: IdealGasMix\nError:     buildSolutionFromXML returned false\n\n\nThis only happens when using my own .cti files, and does not occur \nwhen using the ones provided with the source.  If anyone has had this \nproblem before and knows how to fix it, I would appreciate all the \nhelp I can get. \n\nThanks, \n\nAnup Misra\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}}
