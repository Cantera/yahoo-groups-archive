This updated version works fine on Mac and \nlinux, but there seems to be some problem on Windows that causes some, \nbut not all, example m-files in MATLAB to fail.  I haven&#39;t had time to \ntrack it down yet.  For this reason, I have not posted a new Windows \ninstaller.\n\nI&#39;m going to be out of town through the 28th, and out of email contact. \n  I&#39;ll get back to this when i return, but if any Windows/MATLAB expert \nwants to tackle it in the meantime, you are most welcome to do so...\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
