Does anyone \nthink they could help me with the problem i&#39;m having on installing \nCantera from the source code.  I have the details listed below.\n\nSean\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;hendersonsjh&quot; &lt;henderson.11@j...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Dr Goodwin,\n&gt; I managed to fix the one problem off installing the source code \nfor \n&gt; Cantera in the step using Microsoft Visual Studios.  The config.h \n&gt; was missing from C:&#92;cantera-1.5.3&#92;Cantera&#92;src and this was what \nwas \n&gt; causing the error.  After sucessfully installing building all the \n&gt; files using Visual Studio i then went to the cygwin window and \n&gt; typed &#39;make win&#39; to build the phython interface and Matlab \ntoolboxes.\n&gt; The file from build/include/cantera were sucessfully built but \nwhen \n&gt; cygwin changed directorires to Cantera/python is got the following \n&gt; errors:\n&gt; \n&gt; cd Cantera/python; make win\n&gt; make[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/c/Documents and \nSettings/Sean \n&gt; Henderson/Desktop/New Folder/cantera-1.5.3/Cantera/python&#39;\n&gt; make[1]: *** No rule to make target `and&#39;, needed by `_winbuild&#39;.  \n&gt; Stop.\n&gt; make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/Documents and \nSettings/Sean \n&gt; Henderson/Desktop/New Folder/cantera-1.5.3/Cantera/python&#39;\n&gt; make: *** [python] Error 2\n&gt; \n&gt; It appears that I am missing a files in the Cantera/python \nfolder.  \n&gt; By the way the make &#39;make win&#39; command in cygwin was done in the \n&gt; folder where the source code was extracted from the .zip file and \n&gt; not from C:Cantera-1.5.3 where the project was built using Visual \n&gt; Studio.  Did i make a mistake in installing Cantera or is there \n&gt; another type of error.  Any help would be greatly appriciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank You,\n&gt; Sean\n\n\n"}}
