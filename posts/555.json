An algebraic constraint like the one you are \nimplementing should have diag[j] = 0. It is used to modify the \nsteady-state Jacobian computed in class MultiJac to add the transient \nterm on the diagonal of the Jacobian.  Take a look at method eval in \nclass OneDim - this calls the eval methods of each domain, which each \nset the portions of the mask array (i.e., diag) relevant for that \ndomain. This mask array is then used in updateTransient to modify the \nJacobian for time stepping.  Hope this helps.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Oct 29, 2004, at 8:58 AM, Karl Meredith wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to implement a freely propagating flame in AxiStagnFlow.\n&gt; I have made the modifications to the U-velocity equation and the\n&gt; boundary conditions.
