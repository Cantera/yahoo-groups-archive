I=\r\n have recently installed Cantera as a substitute for Chemkin II \nin certain=\r\n aspects.  \n  The Cantera installer I downloaded is &quot;Cantera160r3.msi&quot;. The=\r\n demo \nfiles works well with Python and Matlab,but the efforts of compiling=\r\n \ndemo file for C++ in VC6 always end in vain. It seems that it&#39;s \nincompat=\r\nible with VC6. Which kind of compiler should I use as a typical \nC++ compil=\r\ner compatible with Cantera? Or if there&#39;s any measure I can \ntake to solve =\r\nthe incompatible problem in VC environment?\n  Thanks in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
