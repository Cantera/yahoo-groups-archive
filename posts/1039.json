You&#39;ll need to install the do=\r\nt\nprogram from GraphViz, if you haven&#39;t already. This is the program\nthat&#39;s=\r\n used to generate the directed graphs (see\nhttp://www.graphviz.org/). Then =\r\nmake sure the dot executable is in\nyour path, or put the full path to the e=\r\nxecutable in the &quot;DOT\nCommand:&quot; box.\n\n-Paul\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;rezvani_reza&quot; &lt;rezvani_reza@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; I tried to install Can=\r\ntera using Windows Installer Package \n&gt; (Cantera160r1), but looks like it d=\r\noes not have all the features,\n&gt; (specially MixMaster).
