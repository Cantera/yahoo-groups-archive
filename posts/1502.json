Also =\r\ni tried to run the configure script that comes\n&gt; with the sundials package =\r\nusing cygwin but was unable to get it to\n&gt; work. Would you have any suggest=\r\nions to fix this.

My Cantera installation (latest) did not prod=\r\nuce any lib\n&gt; &gt; directory with the library files that i need to include in =\r\nthe linker\n&gt; &gt; directive while building the demo.cpp file. (ex: cantera.lib=\r\n, oneD.lib\n&gt; &gt; etc.) I have two DLL files in the Cantera directory: msvcp71=\r\n.dll and\n&gt; &gt; msvcr71.dll. Is there a way to build the demo without the lib =\r\nfiles. I\n&gt; &gt; thought lib files were required at link time to link to the dl=\r\nl files.\n&gt; &gt; Has anybody faced this issue and got it solved?\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in =\r\nadvance, Shyam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
