I recently noticed that when I get the \nthermal diffusion coefficients for GRI30 mech from MATLAB and compare \nit with the results obtained by running my C++ program, some of the \nvalues have opposite signs (i.e, +ve valued in one and -ve in the \nother). I cross checked this by running the transport 2 example in \nc++ for a temperature of 2000 K and gave the same input in MATLAB. I \nhad 4 values that were inconsistent. What is to be done when such a \nsituation props up?\n\nThanks,\n\nNiveditha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
