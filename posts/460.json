This mechanism \nis somewhat elaborate and may require significant \ncomputational time.  However, I know of at least one \npresentation and one paper that has done modeling along with \nexperimental validation of this mechanism under isothermal \nconditions and with some varying stoichiometries.  However, \nyou would need to check out the range where validation has \noccurred (temperature, stoichiometry, and perhaps pressure) \nto ensure that this mechanism will provide any meaningful \nquantitative results.  Also, Dr. Konnov is very helpful if \nyou have any questions about this mechanism.\n\nOne note to all of these searching for mechanisms that are \non the web, I would suggest a search using &quot;Chemkin {Fuel} \nMechanism&quot; where {fuel} is the fuel you are wanting a \nmechanism and appropriate thermodynamic and transport data \nfor or some similar context as that listed above.  \n\nThere are many different mechanisms that are available \nand some even provide a reference list that can be used to \nsearch down the appropriate bibliographic information (which \nis very handy when trying to determine which range of \nconditions the mechanisms has been validated under and also \nwhere reaction rate information was taken from).\n\nFor example a couple of mechanisms that can be found \non the web are from the University of Leeds [methane], the \nGas Research Institute (GRI Mechanisms)[methane], work by \nCharles Westbrook and coworkers at LLNL [multiple fuels \nranging from methane to n-heptane if I recall correctly], \nand on the Berkeley website [comprehensive and reduced \nmethane mechanism]. There are undoubtedly more but this \nshould give everyone a good starting point.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nBrad Lemke\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\n\n"}}
