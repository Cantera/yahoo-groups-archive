After \nsp=\r\nending some time I found that the subroutine ck2ctml contains a small \nbug.=\r\n For formatting purposes it adds a line break `&#92;n&#39; after every ten \nsubstan=\r\nces. When the number of substances is dividable by ten this \nsubroutine add=\r\ns two line breaks. It results in crashing in completely \ndifferent part of =\r\nthe program when the chemical mechanism is written to \nfile because only on=\r\ne line break is expected. The mechanism of Connaire \net al. unfortunately h=\r\nas exactly ten species. The fix is quite simple. \nHow can we commit it in t=\r\nhe code?\nBest regards, Anatoli\n\n\n\n"}}
