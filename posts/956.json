I mean, \nI can create one, and set its temperature and pressure, and get its \ntemperature and pressure, and equilibrate it, and set the quantity of \nmoles of each phase in it (either directly or by species) and get them \nback, and add phases to it.\n\nOh, and I can get the chemical potentials of each species, which means \nI can actually get some thermodynamic data out. \n\nThat, unfortunately, is a pretty limited list.  Thus, my questions:\n\n* Is it possible to get thermodynamic data (energy, entropy, etc.) for \nthe entire mixture out of a Mixture object?  If so, how?\n\n* Is is possible to get thermodynamic data for a given phase out of a \nMixture object?\n\n* Is it possible to get a list of species out of a Mixture object, so \nthat I know which species the various chemical potentials (or \nwhatever) correspond to?\n\n* Is it possible to retrieve a phase from a Mixture object, so that I \ncould otherwise manipulate it to determine the relevant thermodynamic \ndata?\n\n* What is the syntax for the speciesIndex function on a Mixture?  (It \ntakes two arguments other than the mixture, but the comment in the \nfile only mentions one, and it seems that I simply get the second \nargument returned to me if it&#39;s a number, or the ASCII value of the \nfirst letter if it&#39;s a string.)\n\nIn any case, it looks like the Mixture objects are exactly what one of \nmy colleagues needs for the program he&#39;s currently working on, so I&#39;m \nhoping I&#39;m just missing something....\n\nThanks!\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
