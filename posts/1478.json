When I double-clicked on a python script a DOS console window =\r\n\nflashed on the screen (no error message)\n5. If I right click on a script a=\r\nnd then choose to edit the script \nand then try to run it from the python c=\r\nonsole:\n   ImportError: No module named numarray.libnumeric\n6. The offendin=\r\ng line in the script is &quot;import from Cantera *&quot;\n7. So I found the libnumeri=\r\nc installer for python 2.5 and installed \nit.\n8. Same problem.\n9. Searched =\r\nfor answers in the forum, haven&#39;t found any (yet)\n\nHas anyone used winxp an=\r\nd python 2.5 and the cantera 1.7 msi and got \nit to work? If so, how did yo=\r\nu do it? The installation instructions \njust say to run the installer. I fo=\r\nund answers for matlab, but I \ndon&#39;t have that, nor do I have a complier (a=\r\nt least under winxp) so I \nneed to get the winxp installer working with pyt=\r\nhon.\n\nI know next to nothing about python, so how do I tell if libnumeric \n=\r\nis properly installed? I didn&#39;t see anything obvious on a quick \nglance of =\r\nthe python directory structure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
