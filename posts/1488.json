There is CO2 in the gas=\r\n\nphase and the aqueous phase contains various ions such as H+, OH-, and\nCO3=\r\n(-2a). When I run the equilibrium calculation (room temperature),\nall CO2 i=\r\nn the gas phase is transformed into CO3(-2a). \n\nHeats of formation of CO2 i=\r\ns -94 and that of CO3(-2a) is -161\nkcal/mol. But Cantera does not consider =\r\nthe formation of ion which\nprevents CO2 being converted completely into CO3=\r\n(-2a).\n\nI have defined the ionic phase as \n\nstoichiometric_liquid(name =3D =\r\n&quot;l7&quot;,\n      elements =3D &quot; C O &quot;,\n      density =3D (1.0,&#39;g/cm3&#39;),\n      sp=\r\necies =3D &quot;&quot;&quot; CO3(-2a) &quot;&quot;&quot;)\n\nDoes anyone know how to tackle this problem?\n\n=\r\nThank you.\n\n\n\n"}}
