I was checking equilibrium conditions\n&gt; for certain reactions. I have a problem. I carried out a reaction by\n&gt; specifying a temperature and pressure. I used equilibrate function\n&gt; at constant temperature and volume. After this I checked the\n&gt; pressure again. It was equal to the initial pressure specified. The\n&gt; total number of moles are changing in the reaction, and I had\n&gt; carried out the equilibrium at constant temperature and volume. Then\n&gt; why is the pressure same as initially specified?\n&gt; Ajay\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
