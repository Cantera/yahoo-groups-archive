As you may \nremember, I am using Cantera to model rocket thrusters which burn a \nmixture of N2O and C2H6.  I am using reactor 1 to find the time it \ntakes for 99% of the N2O to be consumed as a function of input gas \ntemperature.  I am running these calculations at 100 psi, and for \nO/F ratios 4,5,6,and 10.  For O/F ratios 4, 5, and 6, this works \ngreat for temperatures between 1000 and 3100 K.  However, for O/F \nratios of 10 and above, this only works for temperatures at or above \n1725 K.  For temperatures below 1725, Cantera returns the following \nerror message:\n\nProcedure: CVodeInt\nError:    CVode error encountered.\n\nError in ==&gt; @ReactorNet&#92;private&#92;reactornetmethods at 6\n  v = ctmethods(65, n, job, a);  \n\nError in ==&gt; ReactorNet.advance at 22\nreactornetmethods(8, reactornet_hndl(n), tout);\n\nError in ==&gt; reactor1_test at 59\n   advance(network, t);\n\n\n\nWhat does this error mean, and what might I need to change to get \nresults for this O/F ratio for temperatures lower than 1725 K?\n\nThank you very much,\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n"}}
