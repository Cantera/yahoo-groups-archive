Just installed it today.  But based on the\ndocumentation online it does not appear that Cantera is currently\ncapable of handling 1D spherically symmetric geometry.  If this is so,\nI was wondering if someone could fill me in on the process that would\nbe required for me to add this feature.  What language is the part of\nthe source code that contains the equations written in?  Is there\nsomething I can do through the Matlab toolbox to attain the\nfunctionality I&#39;m looking for?\n\nThanks!\nJLK\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
