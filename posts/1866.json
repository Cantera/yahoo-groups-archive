The opposed jet solution of\ncantera does=\r\nn&#39;t seem to be logical. For same volumetric flow rates \n(thus same exit vel=\r\nocities) of pure methane and air, the flame is\nlocated somewhere in the mid=\r\ndle by cantera. But the molar\nstoichoimetric Air to methane ratio is 17. Th=\r\nis means flame should be\nlocated very close to air nozzle. My experimental =\r\nobservations also\nverifies this fact as flame is observed only a mm away fr=\r\nom the\noxidizer nozzle. How can I fix cantera in this respect. Is this a\npr=\r\noblem related to diffusion. Any help is appreciated.\n\nThanks everybody \n\n\n\n"}}
