Does this mean that where \nnumerics are required in the .cti file, the names of variables \npreviously defined/declared in the Matlab script can be used \ninstead?  Should these variables be global?  How should they be \ndefined or declared?  For example, is the following .cti file \nsection valid? (Assume the variables Temp, Pres, and Gmlf are \ndefined/declared before the importPhase() or importInterface() \ncommand is executed)\n\nideal_gas(\tname = &#39;gas&#39;,\n\t\telements = &#39;O N C&#39;,\n\t\tspecies = &#39;O2 N2 CO CO2 O2*&#39;,\n\t\treactions = &#39;all&#39;,\n\t\tinitial_state = state(\ttemperature = Temp, \n\t\t\t\t\tpressure = Pres,\n\t\t\t\t\tmole_fractions = Gmlf))\n\n\nThanks\nPaul\n\n\n"}}
