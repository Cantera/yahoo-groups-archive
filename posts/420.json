I made only one change to this \nChemkin-&gt;Cantera conversion code, to better handle differences in line \nendings between DOS, unix, and Mac text files.  Are the affected \nspecies names at the end of a line in the SPECIES block? The best thing \nI can recommend is to send me the file off-line and I&#39;ll try it out.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jun 17, 2004, at 10:20 AM, niveditaah wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I was using cantera 1.5.3 till now and was able to successfully\n&gt; convert chemkin format files into .cti files. After I installed\n&gt; 1.5.4, I am having trouble converting a particular mechanism file\n&gt; into the .cti file. I was able to convert it with the older version\n&gt; though.\n&gt;\n&gt; The mechanism is a surrogate for JP8. I checked out the ck2cti.log\n&gt; for the error and I see that many species are read together as one\n&gt; specie. For example H2O and CO2 are read as H2OCO2. I have tried\n&gt; changing the order of the species and I get the same error.How do I\n&gt; rectify this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Niveditha\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
