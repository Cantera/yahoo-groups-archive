The reason for\nasking this question is that imposing mdot\nmakes the system overdetermined if it is not\na boundary condition of an additional differential\nequation.\n\n\n(2) The value of mdot is imposed at both the inflow\nand outflow domain. Although the flames we calculated\nup to now achor themseves at the inlet boundary,\nI wondered whether the location of acnchoring depends\non the value of mdot. Or is there some kind of\n&quot;translational invariance&quot; due to imposing mdot?\n\nWith best regards,\n\nArief\n\n\n\n\n"}}
