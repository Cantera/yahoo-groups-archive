Can&#39;t you do what you want by giving all  \nspecies identical transport parameters?  If not, you would need to do  \nsome C++ programming: derive a new transport manager class from class  \nTransport, and in that class implement calculation of diffusion  \ncoefficients however you like.\n\n\nOn Nov 9, 2006, at 2:39 AM, robgordon101 wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m running some cases with a mod of the demo opposed flow flame\n&gt; template &quot;diffflame.m&quot;.
