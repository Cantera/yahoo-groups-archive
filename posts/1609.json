However, =\r\nI still end up \nwith the same results (flame speed and temp) with and witho=\r\nut thermal diffusion.  \nThinking it may be my code, I also ran flame2.py wi=\r\nth and without thermal diffusion and \narrived at the same results.  I belie=\r\nve I&#39;ve downloaded from CVS correctly as I have the new \nversion of flame2.=\r\npy, which includes &#39;enableSoret()&#39;.  Must this line (and those associated \n=\r\nwith it) be turned &#39;off&#39; or can it simply be commented out?  In the cases I=\r\n&#39;ve run, I&#39;ve \ncommented them out.  Is there something else I&#39;m missing?\n\nT=\r\nhanks.\nRusty   \n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I looked into this, and much to my surprise it seems you can&#39;=\r\nt turn  \n&gt; on thermal diffusion in flame simulations from Python or MATLAB.=\r\n It  \n&gt; works from C++.  In an older version of the Cantera Python interfac=\r\ne,  \n&gt; this capability existed, but somehow it was left out when part of  \n=\r\n&gt; this interface was rewritten.  I have now put it in.\n&gt; \n&gt;  From Python, y=\r\nou can call a method &#39;enableSoret()&#39; that turns on  \n&gt; thermal diffusion. T=\r\nhis change has been checked into the CVS  \n&gt; repository. See example flame2=\r\n.py where this is used.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 22, 2007, at 10:38 AM, rustoleump=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if the diffusion effects (Soret, Dufour, et=\r\nc) are  \n&gt; &gt; enabled automatically\n&gt; &gt; with the multicomponent transport?  =\r\nI&#39;m using the freely  \n&gt; &gt; propagating adiabatic flame\n&gt; &gt; example with an =\r\nH2-O2 mechanism and I&#39;m not able to match the flame  \n&gt; &gt; speed with the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; literature.
