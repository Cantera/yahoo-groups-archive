You can specify \nthe max number of iterations when you call equilibrate. Also you can \nspecify an error tolerance. The default is a very strict error \ntolerance.  You can probably set it to a much higher value without \nsignificant loss of accuracy.\nYou might also compare the performance of the two solvers by supplying \nthe parameter &quot;solver = 1&quot; or &quot;solver = 2&quot;.  Look at the example \n&quot;stoich.py&quot; in the Python demos/equilibrium folder for an example of \nhow to choose the solver and specify parameters.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jun 30, 2005, at 3:16 PM, csmnofbobs wrote:\n\n&gt; Dr. Goodwin,\n&gt; I am trying to use reactor1 to calculate the time it takes for a\n&gt; mixture of N2O and C2H6 to reach equilibrium.  To do this, I use\n&gt; equilibrate(gas,HP) to determine the equilibrium molar mass for a\n&gt; given set of input conditions, and then have reactor iterate until\n&gt; the molar mass of the gas is within 1% of this value and record the\n&gt; end time.  I have a loop set up to run this procedure at many\n&gt; different temperatures and save all the data in an excell file.  The\n&gt; problem is that equilibrate often returns the &quot;no convergence in 1000\n&gt; iterations&quot; error, which stops all the calculations and keeps the\n&gt; data from being saved.  It is puzzling because equilibrate only\n&gt; sometimes returns the error.  If I run equilibrate over and over\n&gt; without changing any of the input conditions, it sometimes reaches a\n&gt; solution, and sometimes returns the error.  It seems that I either\n&gt; need some way to increase the maximum number of iterations, or a way\n&gt; to tell Cantera to rerun equilibrate until it reaches a solution, as\n&gt; opposed to stopping entirely.  Are either one of these options\n&gt; possible?\n&gt; Thank you very much, and have a great Independence Day.\n&gt; Jeff Miller\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
