Is this the technique people have used until \nnow?\n\nAlso I wondered if the Cantera sensitivity analysis will be able to \ndetermine the sensitivity with respect to species thermochemistry, or \njust with respect to the rate coefficients? I am using a mechanism in \nwhich many species have poorly known themochemistries, so would be \ninterested in the ability to tell which ones really matter.\n\nMany thanks for your excellent work Dave.\n\nRegards,\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n"}}
