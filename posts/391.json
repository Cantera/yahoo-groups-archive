Cantera  \nis supposed to handle this case cleanly, but it seems it is failing.   \nThe workaround is to specify in the cti file &quot;transport = &#39;CK_Mix&#39;,&quot;,  \nrather than &quot;transport = &#39;Mix&#39;,&quot;.  This changes the algorithm used to  \nset the temperature range for the fits so that the fit is always done  \nwith T*=100 as the upper limit, and T*=0.1 as the lower limit.  It also  \nchanges other options to make computation of transport properties as  \nclose as possible to the algorithm used by Chemkin, even at the expense  \nof accuracy (using lower-order polynomial fits).  This bug will be  \nfixed in the upcoming release (within a few days), and will be fixed in  \nthe development version in the CVS repository within the next hour.\n\nDave\n\n\nfits of the collision integrals for the transport properties go out of  \nthe range of the tables used to\n\nOn May 21, 2004, at 9:16 AM, gfcoppola wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Goodwin,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am now trying to run Cantera with the GRI30 &#39;modified&#39; to\n&gt; take into account Helium.\n&gt; I produced the &#39;modified&#39; gri30.cti using the command line utility\n&gt; ch2cti and the resulting file is produced without error messages.\n&gt; When I try to run the Python demo file &quot;npflame1&quot; or the Matlab demo\n&gt; file &quot;diffflame&quot;, with the following lines\n&gt; gas = importPhase(&#39;gri30He.cti&#39;)\n&gt; or\n&gt; gas = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30He.cti&#39;)\n&gt; instead of\n&gt; gas = GRI30(&#39;Mix&#39;)\n&gt; the result is a segmentation fault.\n&gt; Do you have any suggestion ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks\n&gt; Gianfilippo Coppola\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
