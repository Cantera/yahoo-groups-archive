The\npaper is:\n\nD. G. Goodwin, &quot;An open-source, extensible software suite for CVD\nprocess simulation,&quot; Proceedings of CVD XVI and EuroCVD Fourteen,\nElectrochemical Society, 2003 (in press).\n\nA preprint is available at\nhttp://blue.caltech.edu/cantera_dist/doc/cantera_ecs2003.pdf.\n\n\nHere are a few answers to recent questions:\n\n1. I haven&#39;t installed Visual Studio .NET yet, so don&#39;t know if there\nare issues getting Cantera to compile with it.\n\n2. Cantera may not work with Matlab 5 (haven&#39;t tried it). Also, if you\nare using a Matlab 6 version other than the one used to build the Matlab\ntoolbox in the release, you will need to rebuild the Matlab toolbox.\nThis can be done from within Matlab. You need a C compiler configured to\nwork in Matlab (do &#39;mex -setup&#39;). Go to the Cantera toolbox directory,\nand type &#39;buildwin&#39; or &#39;buildunix&#39;.\n\n3. The new version of Cantera no longer requires setting environment\nvariables under Windows. (But for what its worth, in Windows 98 you have\nto edit AUTOEXEC.BAT and reboot. A better solution: upgrade to Win 2000\nor Win XP...)\n\n4. Chemical equilibrium calculations require a sufficient number of\nspecies in the reaction mechanism. Otherwise, method &#39;equilibrate&#39; will\nfail with an error message. At a minimum, you need as many species as\nelements, and these must span &#39;element space.&#39; That is, any mixture\nelemental composition must be achievable for some set of species mole\nfractions. \n\nAlso, compositions that correspond to exactly stoichiometric combustion\noften cause &#39;equilibrate&#39; to fail to converge, since the equilibrium\ncomposition is a very sensitive function of equivalence ratio here. The\nsolution is to move away a very small amount from this composition.\n\n\n\n"}}
