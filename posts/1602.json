It  \nworks from C++.  In an older version of the Cantera Python interface,  \nthis capability existed, but somehow it was left out when part of  \nthis interface was rewritten.  I have now put it in.\n\n From Python, you can call a method &#39;enableSoret()&#39; that turns on  \nthermal diffusion. This change has been checked into the CVS  \nrepository. See example flame2.py where this is used.\n\n\n\nOn Apr 22, 2007, at 10:38 AM, rustoleump wrote:\n\n&gt; Does anyone know if the diffusion effects (Soret, Dufour, etc) are  \n&gt; enabled automatically\n&gt; with the multicomponent transport?  I&#39;m using the freely  \n&gt; propagating adiabatic flame\n&gt; example with an H2-O2 mechanism and I&#39;m not able to match the flame  \n&gt; speed with the\n&gt; literature.  My results are about 7% too high.  When I checked the  \n&gt; source code, I found the\n&gt; line m_do_soret(false) in the file StFlow.cpp and it seems to me  \n&gt; that this would force the\n&gt; Soret effect to be off.  I&#39;ve run the same grid with multicomponent  \n&gt; and mixture averaged\n&gt; transport with different results - the mixture averaged is slightly  \n&gt; higher as I would expect.\n&gt; I have changed the line to m_do_soret(true), recompiled and it  \n&gt; didn&#39;t change the result.
