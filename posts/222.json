I could do it in Excel, but I thought I\ncould just do some of the calculations in Python and add a column for\nmixture fraction to the csv file that is written.  Seems like I should be\nable to call out something like the mass fraction for a particular element,\nor the number of hydrogen atoms that that species has, etc.\n\nI haven&#39;t been able to figure out the nuances of syntax for the gas object,\nor how python should tease them out.  (I have figured out things like\ngas.meanMolecularWeight () , and getting the full list of Species Names,\netc.)\n\n\n\nIf you have a few minutes, could you give me a quick and dirty on the\nstructure of the gas object?  (Or maybe send me a reference to the correct\nheader file that could clear it up).\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\nHouston Miller\n\n\n"}}
