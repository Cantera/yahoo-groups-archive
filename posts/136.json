Try using single-step mode:\n\nrctr = Reactor()\ntfinal = 10.0\ntnow = 0.0\nwhile tnow &lt; tfinal:\n     tnow = rctr.step(tfinal) # take 1 internal timestep toward tfinal.\n     print tnow, rctr.temperature()\n\nThis won&#39;t get it to converge, but at least you can see what it is  \ndoing just before it fails.\n\nAlso, if you are using a Wall object with a large value of the heat  \ntransfer coefficient or expansion constant, this can lead to numerical  \nproblems like you describe.\nTry using smaller values in this case, or doing an adiabatic, constant  \nvolume simulation to see if the problem persists.\n\nDave G.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, May 14, 2003, at 08:40 PM, steve@...  \nwrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am seeing multiple failure modes when using the reactor (zerod)  \n&gt; methods\n&gt; from python.  Sometimes this:\n&gt;\n&gt; ====\n&gt; CVode-- At t=1.6711 and step size h=6.69619e-10, the corrector\n&gt; convergence failed repeatedly or with |h| = hmin.\n&gt;\n&gt; Traceback (most recent call last):\n&gt;   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 6, in ?\n&gt;   File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/Cantera/Reactor.py&quot;, line 97,  \n&gt; in advance\n&gt;     return _cantera.reactor_advance(self.__reactor_id, time)\n&gt; cantera.error:  CVode error encountered.\n&gt; ===\n&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes just a &quot;hang&quot; as if the code is caught in a tight loop.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Approaching the &quot;trouble spot&quot; along different pressure/temperature  \n&gt; trajectories\n&gt; has some small effect but there seems to be a &quot;wall&quot; at a particular\n&gt; temperature that the code won&#39;t integrate past.\n&gt;\n&gt; Where should I start looking for the source of the problem?\n&gt; Are there standard tricks to check the thermo and kinetic databases for\n&gt; known problems?  The thermo database is pretty standard but the\n&gt; mechanism is pulled together from several sources -- primarily\n&gt; the nist database on fluorinated hydrocarbons.\n&gt;\n&gt; \t\t\t\t\tThanks for any help -\n&gt; \t\t\t\t\t\tSteve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
