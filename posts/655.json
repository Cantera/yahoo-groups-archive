I do some transient \nreactor network simulation in Matlab. During the simulations I need \nto change the configuration of the reactor network several times. \nTherefore I delete the network object from the Matlab workspace and \nthan I recreate the modified one. But after a while I run out of \nmemory. The commands cleanup, clear and so don&#39;t affect anything. \nOnly finishing the entire Matlab helps. \nSo far I couldn&#39;t localize the reason for this, is it Matlab or is it \nsomething in the Cantera library. (By the way I download the cantera \nbinary and I&#39;m not so familiar in debugging). \nBut recently I read this email of Martin Olausson and your answer \nwith recommendation to use the program appdelete() in misc.cpp. Can \nyou tell me how I have to use it through the matlab interface. Which \nsteps are there required?\nThank you very much.\n  Regards\n     Albrecht \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
