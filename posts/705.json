I&#39;m\nnot sure if it&#39;s something with Matlab&#39;s variable handling or\nsomething with the Cantera code itself. I plan on trying to\nduplicate this in either Python or C++  to investigate whether it\nis something in Cantera. In the meantime, here&#39;s a short Matlab\nscript that demonstrates this issue:\n\nclear all;\ngas1 = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;);\ngas2 = gas1;\ngas1\nset(gas2,&#39;T&#39;,500);\ngas1\ngas2\n\ngas1 should still be at 300K but it is showing up at 500K like gas2.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks in advance -\n\nJosh Freeh\n\n\n\n\n"}}
