Using MixMaster\n&gt; with Python, GRI-Mech 3.0, 1 mole of CH4 gets well divided into\n&gt; Hydrogen, Acetylene and a variety of other gaseous hydrocarbons.\n&gt; What is peculiar is that two other thermo chemical calculators I have\n&gt; used, Gaseq and the NASA CEA calculator, predict a large concentration\n&gt; of solid carbon and gaseous hydrogen. Furthermore an experiment was\n&gt; done to dissociate Methane to produce carbon and hydrogen at 1 atm at\n&gt; similar temperatures. The link is below and MixMaster used the way I\n&gt; did yields different results. Does anybody have experience with using\n&gt; Cantera to predict dissociation of Methane?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Alex\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/28890h.pdf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
