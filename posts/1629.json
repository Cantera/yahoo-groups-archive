It is probably best to check out a fresh=\r\n working copy, rather  \n&gt; than update an existing one. The new features are=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Thread safe build option.  Cantera can optionally be built to be =\r\n \n&gt; thread safe, which insures that static data (e.g. cached error  \n&gt; mess=\r\nages) are modified by only one thread at a time. This option  \n&gt; requires t=\r\nhe Boost thread library (which is why it is not the  \n&gt; default).  You can =\r\ndownload Boost from www.boost.org.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Faster chemical equilibrium. The=\r\n equilibrium routines were  \n&gt; spending quite a bit of time writing detaile=\r\nd logfiles. Now this can  \n&gt; be turned off, or completely compiled out of t=\r\nhe code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both of these options may be set in the preconfig script. Ple=\r\nase  \n&gt; report any build problems with this new version.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
