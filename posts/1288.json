I came across something\nthat I=\r\n can&#39;t explain other than that there might be something odd\ngoing on inside=\r\n the intEnergy_mass call.  I&#39;m trying to calculate the\nfollowing energy val=\r\nues:  Enthalpy (enthalpy_mass), Entropy\n(entropy_mass), Internal (intEnergy=\r\n_mass), Gibbs (gibbs_mass), and\nHelmholtz.  There is currently (as far as I=\r\n could find) not a call to\ncalculate the Helmholtz energy.  I just used the=\r\n other values to\ncalculate it myself.    I&#39;m using calculated Temperature a=\r\nnd Species\nfraction profiles across a given domain at several discrete poin=\r\nts. \nAt each node, I am setting the state with the setState_TPY call to\nCan=\r\ntera.  On the first node (ie. first calls to the energy functions\nin my cod=\r\ne) it seems to do fine.  Successive calls to the energy\nfunctions at each s=\r\nuccesive node, however, return NAN (Enthalpy,\nEntropy, Internal, and Gibbs)=\r\n.  After messing around with it for a\nbit, I found out that if I didn&#39;t cal=\r\nl the intEnergy_mass function,\nthat everything calculates just fine.  I dou=\r\nble checked the values\nthat I was passing to the setState_TPY function and =\r\neverything was\ncorrect (valid numbers, no negative mass fractions, etc).  T=\r\nhe only\nthing that I can figure is that there is something awry with the\nin=\r\ntEnergy_mass call.  If someone else can verify this and it leads to\na bug f=\r\nix, great.  If not, then I&#39;ll chalk it up to the little imp\nnamed Murphy wh=\r\no sits upon my shoulder each day, and calculate U\ndirectly myself.  Thanks.=\r\n\n\nDan Smyth\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
