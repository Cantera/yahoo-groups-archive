Not because of Cantera. My supervisor \nArief Dahoe discovered it after I left yesterday and fixed it.\nAnd now, he wants to replace Windows by Linux in fireSert.\nThanks for your help.\nYours sincerely,\nSolene \n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Is carbon in the list of elements?\n&gt; \n&gt; On May 26, 2005, at 11:11 AM, se_deferrieres wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We managed to add nitrogen to H2O2.cti and to flame1.m.
