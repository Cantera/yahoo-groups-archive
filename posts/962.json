For solutions saved as xml \nfiles, you said the following:\n\nAlternatively, if you have a solution that you previously saved to an\nxml file using the\ncommand:\nflame.save(&#39;flame.xml&#39;, id = &#39;firstBC&#39; ).\n\n, you can load the solution into another flame object or the same\nusing the\ncommands:\nflame2.init()\nflame2.restore(&#39;flame.xml&#39;, id = &#39;firstBC&#39;)\n\nAnd then change the boundary and operating conditions of this flame\nobject (&quot;flame2&quot;) using\nthe &quot;set&quot; commands as above.\n\n\nI am trying to use this for the freely propagating adiabatic flame \ndemo on python, but have had no success.  I commented out the \nportions of the demo that solve without the energy equation, and that \nsolve with the energy equation on, but with &#39;mix&#39; transport \nproperties, since both are used as initial guesses for solving with \nthe &#39;multi&#39; transport properties.  Where should I put f.init() and \nf.restore?  I placed them after f.inlet.set(), and when I run the \ndemo, it appears to load the solution from the previous run, but then \nit just sits there.  I let it run for about two hours before deciding \nto restart the shell (the calculation I ran to get the solution I am \nusing as the initial guess took only 5 minutes).  Do you have any \nadvice?\n\nThank you very much,\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n"}}
