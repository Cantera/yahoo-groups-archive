Nevertheless, if I use large mechanisms I \ncan only see the first 20-40 reactions depending on my screen resolution. Would it \nbe possible to include a scroll function in this window in a future release of \nMixmaster? \n \nFurthermore, I have a Cantera_work directory on my linux box, where I keep all \nfiles from my simulations, but when I use Mixmaster, the program tend to dump all \nthe files it creates during a run in the root of my home directory. Would it be \npossible to make Mixmaster dump it&#39;s files in the directory where a data file is \nloaded from in a future release of Mixmaster? \n \nFinally, just a minor detail. In the Help -&gt; About Cantera... there is no pop-up \nwindow. When I run Mixmaster on a windows XP machine I get several error \nmessages when I press the About Cantera..., and on one occasion it crashed \npython. \n \nThat&#39;s all \n \nBest Regards \nMartin \n\n\n"}}
