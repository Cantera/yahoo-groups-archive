Simply define ionized species as  \n=\r\n&gt; containing the special element &quot;E&quot;.  Foe example, K+ would contain  \n&gt; on=\r\ne atom of  potassium, and -1 atoms of &quot;E&quot;.\n&gt; Cantera comes with some thermo=\r\n files, at least one of which has the  \n&gt; thermo properties for gaseous ele=\r\nctrons.   As far as equilibrium  \n&gt; (Saha equation), the solvers handle cha=\r\nrged species fine, and the  \n&gt; results would be the same as computed from t=\r\nhe Saha equation.  Take a  \n&gt; look at the Python demo &quot;multiphase_plasma.py=\r\n&quot; in the demos/Python/ \n&gt; equilibrium folder. It has both multiple condense=\r\nd phases and ionized  \n&gt; gaseous species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On May 24, 2=\r\n006, at 11:34 AM, Rick_Muller wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in whether anyon=\r\ne is using Cantera to simulate  \n&gt; &gt; reactions\n&gt; &gt; of ionized species such =\r\nas would occur in a weakly ionized gas. It\n&gt; &gt; seems to me that one could a=\r\nugment the normal kinetics that come out\n&gt; &gt; of a GRI reaction mechanism wi=\r\nth a Saha equation calculation of the\n&gt; &gt; ionization process. However, this=\r\n would require that electrons be\n&gt; &gt; treated as actual species in the react=\r\nion mechanism, and I don&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; whether there are serious problems in d=\r\noing this.
