I try t=\r\no implement surface \n&gt; chemistry in a plug flow reactor, but the surface ch=\r\nemistry is not \n&gt; implented ( I create a cti. file with all the reaction an=\r\nd datas,and it \n&gt; can be read by the cantera.) The reaction time is much lo=\r\nnger than \n&gt; expected. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Can someone tell me how to implement the surf=\r\nace chemistry? Do you have \n&gt; any example of the  PFR model? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank yo=\r\nu \n&gt; \n&gt; Crystal\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
