This method uses\nthe Newton a=\r\nlgorithm. It is not clear why only half of the Newton\nincrement (dt) is app=\r\nlied. For the specified tolerance (=3D1.0e-4K) and\nthe maximum number of it=\r\nerations (=3D50) this approach is not always\nworking. \nHowever, the method =\r\nbecomes succesful when the complete Newton\nincrement (dt) is added to the t=\r\nemperature-variable. Does anyone know \n\n1) what is the reason of using 1/2 =\r\nof dt?\n2) why the temperature tolerance passed to the method =3D 1.0e-4K?\n\n=\r\nAlexey\n\n\n\n"}}
