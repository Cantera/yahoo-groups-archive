Currently, although using an older version of MATLAB will  \nresult in ctmethods.dll being correctly built, the installer does not  \ncopy it to the installation folder.\n\nNote that a dummy file with the other extension is installed too,  \nsince there is no simple way to conditionally install files with  \ndifferent names using the Visual Studio Installer. You may need to  \ndelete this manually once you have run the MSI file and installed the  \nMATLAB toolbox, but probably MATLAB will find the correct file.  The  \ndummy file is the one that is smaller - it is a text file that  \ncontains the single line &quot;delete me!&quot;.\n\nIf you have run the MSI installer that has only ctmethods.mex32, but  \nyou are using an older version of MATLAB, you may be able to use a  \nMEX file I built with MATLAB 7 R 14: http://blue.caltech.edu/~dgg/ \nctmethods.dll.  All you need to do is to save this file to the MATLAB \n&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera folder in the Cantera installation folder.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
