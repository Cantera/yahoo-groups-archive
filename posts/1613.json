And as rightly documented it is for dilute solution.  I am interested in concentrated solution but the important point is the infrastrucutre is there and we can develop things from that.  I&#39;ll see if I have the time to develop the Pitzer implementation of this activity coefficients.  In the mean time how can I download the source codes for the C++ and matlab version of CANTERA without going to source forge or something like that?  Thanks for the service you have done to the scientific community.  \n   \n  sincerely,\n   \n   \n  ric\n\nDavid Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n          Yes, it can do this.
