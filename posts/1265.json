Since K_eq can not be negavtive (at least f=\r\nrom my\nknowledge of basic statistical thermodynamics) a negative k_a would\n=\r\nresult in k_b being negative as well. For a simple reaction, say,\n\na + b =\r\n=3D c\n\nthe rate equation is:\n\nr =3D k_f *[a]*[b] - k_b[c]\n\nChanging the sig=\r\nn of both k_f and k_b \n\nr =3D -k_f *[a]*[b] + k_b*[c]\n\nThis is actually equ=\r\nal to the rate equation of the reverse reaction.\nThus, in my point of view =\r\na negative prefactor is just a &quot;cover up&quot; of\nthe fact that the reaction was=\r\n written up in the wrong direction. \nDoes this make any sense, or have I co=\r\nmpletely missed the point here?\n\nKind regards\n\nAnders   \n\n--- In cantera@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;Dan Smyth&quot; &lt;das69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have successfu=\r\nlly installed Cantera onto my Linux box and am trying\n&gt; to replace numerous=\r\n Chemkin subroutines in a code of mine with\n&gt; corresponding Cantera calls. =\r\n I have translated a mechanism from the\n&gt; Chemkin format into Cantera forma=\r\nt by using the ck2cti program with\n&gt; the verification option and seemed to =\r\npass.

From\n&gt; what I have found by looking around the avai=\r\nlable Cantera literature,\n&gt; the only way that a negative pre-exponential fa=\r\nctor can be used inside\n&gt; Cantera is for it to be declared as part of a dup=\r\nlicate reaction, be\n&gt; declared as having the option negative_A, and have th=\r\ne total overall\n&gt; rate be positive.  Something is happening here though, as=\r\n the even the\n&gt; rate coefficients are being returned as &quot;nan&quot; values.  This=\r\n is\n&gt; consistent with both the forward and reverse coefficients, and\n&gt; obvi=\r\nously the forward and reverse rates of progress.  Am I\n&gt; understanding all =\r\nthis correctly?\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I can tell, I&#39;m within the parameters set by=\r\n Cantera to use\n&gt; negative pre-exponential factors, but I&#39;m getting these b=\r\nogus values\n&gt; in return, and am not sure (what to do)/(what to check) next.=\r\n  Do you\n&gt; know what might be wrong?  Is there something else that I can ch=\r\neck to\n&gt; make sure that I&#39;m doing things right?  Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dan Smyth\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
