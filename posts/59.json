It is a\nfairly simple modification to include a single pure phase; let me look\nand see if there is a quick fix. The presence of *multiple* condensed\nphases can cause some numerical problems for the algorithm used. In\nfact, this &#39;element potential&#39; algorithm is not well-suited for\nmultiphase problems, although it is very fast for the single-phase case.\n\nTo do an equilibrium calculation specifying only the elemental\ncomposition, simply give as input any composition that has the desired\nelemental composition. The equilibrium composition depends only on the\nelemental composition and the values of the two properties held\nconstant. You can even specify the initial state is composed of atomic\nH, C, O, and N in the right proportions. (You would probably want to\nhold T, P constant in this case.)\n\nThere is no plug flow model, but if you don&#39;t want to include a pressure\ndrop then you can use the zero-D reactor model, and map the time to\nposition by dx = v(x)dt. Of course, it would be better to have a model\nthat takes care of this for you. It is not hard to write - I&#39;ll try to\ninclude it in the next release.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
