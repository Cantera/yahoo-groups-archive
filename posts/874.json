Thank you for the response.  I now have Intel Visual Fortran \n8 integrated to Visual Studio .NET.  However, I still cannot get the \nf77 demo program to work.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been through so far:\n\nWhen I open the original f77demo.dsw workspace file (found in the \ncantera-1.5.5/tools/templates/f77 folder) it asks me to convert to \ncurrent Visual c++ project format.  I accept and it generates a \nf77demo.sln solution file which appears to be the equivalent of the \nold &quot;workspaces&quot;.  I came across an option under the project menu \nto &quot;extract compaq visual fortran project items&quot;.  I select this and \nit tells me I have both Fortran and C++ project files that need to \nbe split into 2 projects.  I select the fortran project as the main \nproject and c++ project as the &quot;static library project that \ncontributes object files to the link step of the main project.&quot;  I \nreally thought I was getting somewhere when I found this..\n\nBoth projects compile ok (once I change the directory of the header \nfiles as mentioned in a previous post).  When I try to build, I get \na number of errors.  The first set are all similar to:\n\nlibcd.lib(dbgheap.obj) : error LNK2005: __nh_malloc already defined \nin LIBC.lib(malloc.obj)\n\nI fixed these by setting the &quot;ignore all default libraries&quot; option \nunder the f77demo project properties in the &quot;linker&quot; tab.  That \nhasn&#39;t quite fixed it.  Now when I build I get the following output:\n\n\n*********\n\n\n------ Build started: Project: f77demo, Configuration: Debug|Win32 --\n----\n\nLinking...\nLink /OUT:&quot;Debug/f77demo.exe&quot; /INCREMENTAL:NO /NOLOGO /NODEFAULTLIB /\nDEBUG /PDB:&quot;Debug/f77demo.pdb&quot; /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE kernel32.lib \nuser32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib \nshell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib odbc32.lib \nodbccp32.lib /MACHINE:I386 Debug/demo.obj &quot;c:&#92;Documents and \nSettings&#92;rak2287&#92;Desktop&#92;f77 - run through&#92;Debug&#92;f77demo_lib.lib&quot;\nLink: executing &#39;link&#39;\ndemo.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __fltused\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_for_set_reentrancy referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_for_write_seq_lis referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_NEWIDEALGASMIX@24 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_SETSTATE_TPX_STRING@16 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _TEMPERATURE@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_for_write_seq_fmt referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _PRESSURE@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_for_write_seq_fmt_xmit referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _DENSITY@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_ENTHALPY_MOLE@0 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _ENTROPY_MOLE@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _CP_MOLE@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _EQUILIBRATE@8 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _NREACTIONS@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_GETFWDRATESOFPROGRESS@4 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_GETREVRATESOFPROGRESS@4 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_GETNETRATESOFPROGRESS@4 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_GETREACTIONEQN@12 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_for_emit_diagnostic referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _VISCOSITY@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_THERMALCONDUCTIVITY@0 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_GETMIXDIFFCOEFFS@4 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_for_write_seq_lis_xmit referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _NSPECIES@0 \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \n_GETSPECIESNAME@12 referenced in function _MAIN__\ndemo.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _for_stop_core \nreferenced in function _MAIN__\nLINK : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _mainCRTStartup\nDebug/f77demo.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 28 unresolved externals\n\n\nf77demo build failed.\n\n**************\n\n\nI am currently looking into what these different linker errors mean. \nHowever, like I mentioned before, my programming experience is \npretty limited, so I thought I would post where I am at so far and \nhope that some of the more experienced Cantera users/programmers \ncould point me in the right direction.  I would really appreciate \nanyone&#39;s help!\n\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; It would be easiest to use a Fortran compiler that is compatible \nwith \n&gt; Visual Studio .NET.  I think the Intel Fortran compiler is.  Since \nI \n&gt; hardly ever use a PC anymore, perhaps someone else can better \nanswer \n&gt; this question.\n&gt; \n&gt; The f77 and f90 demo programs can all be built very easily on \nsystems \n&gt; that support the GNU tools (make, autoconf, etc.) and compilers \n(g++, \n&gt; g77).  In my opinion, anyone planning to do serious work in \nFortran (or \n&gt; C++) with Cantera should at least consider getting a machine that \nruns \n&gt; some unix-like operating system, such as linux or Mac OS X.  You \ncan \n&gt; get one for less than $1K, and don&#39;t need to buy expensive \ncommercial \n&gt; compilers.

I \nbuilt\n&gt; &gt; and installed Cantera from the source code using Visual C++ .NET,\n&gt; &gt; then I found the f77demo project under the source code download\n&gt; &gt; directory:  cantera-1.5.5&#92;tools&#92;templates&#92;f77.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6.a installed, which is what I\n&gt; &gt; created my original Fortran program on.  I tried opening and\n&gt; &gt; building the f77demo project, but the header files \n(idealgasmix.h,\n&gt; &gt; etc) could not be located.  I fixed this by changing the paths to\n&gt; &gt; the header files in the demo_ftnlib.cpp file to\n&gt; &gt; C:&#92;Cantera&#92;include&#92;cantera&#92;***.h, which is where the Cantera\n&gt; &gt; installation apparently puts them.  This fixed that problem, but \nnow\n&gt; &gt; I get a bunch of &quot;unresolved external symbol&quot; errors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The readme file included in the f77demo project folder states \nthat I\n&gt; &gt; can just open the project file and build it because Compaq Visual\n&gt; &gt; Fortran 6.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 share a common \ndevelopment\n&gt; &gt; environment (Visual Studio).  Is this not the case with Visual\n&gt; &gt; C++ .NET?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is my understanding that I need to create the .obj file from \nthe\n&gt; &gt; demo_ftnlib.cpp and run the included makefile to link that .obj \nfile\n&gt; &gt; to the one created by the Fortran program.  If this is not what \nis\n&gt; &gt; supposed to happen, please let me know.  Obviously at this \npoint, I\n&gt; &gt; am having trouble just creating the object file from the\n&gt; &gt; demo.ftnlib.cpp file.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As you can probably tell, my programming experience is very\n&gt; &gt; limited.  If someone can point me in the right direction to get \nthe\n&gt; &gt; demo program working it would be greatly appreciated!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
