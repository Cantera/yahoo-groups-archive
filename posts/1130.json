I am using the burner stabilized flame simulation in \nMatl=\r\nab.  I would like to plot the species mole fraction profiles, but \nthe plot=\r\nSolution command defaults to mass fractions.  I have dug \nthrough quite a f=\r\new m-files looking for a place to change this, with no \nsuccess.  Does anyo=\r\nne know how to use plotSolution to plot mole \nfraction profiles?  More impo=\r\nrtantly, I need to access the raw data of \nthe solution.  I know that it is=\r\n saved in an xml file.  How do I pull \nspecific things out of the xml file =\r\nsuch as temperature, density, and \nmole fraction profiles?  \nThank you for =\r\nany advice you can offer.\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
