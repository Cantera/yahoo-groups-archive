This function has the effect of  \nexpanding the volume whenever the pressure goes slightly above the  \nsetpoint, and contracting it when it goes below, thereby forcing the  \npressure to stay very close to the setpoint value.  The coefficient  \nshould be set to a value large enough so that the pressure deviations  \nare sufficiently small, but not so large that numerical problems occur.\n\nActually, while this all works, reactor_ode.m is the old way of doing  \nkinetics simulations.  The new way is to use class Reactor.  There  \nshould be examples of how to do this in the &#39;demo&#39; folder.\nHope this helps.\n\nDave G.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 4, 2003, at 12:59 PM, y2kpac wrote:\n\n&gt; In the suggested matlab code for the function vdot.m (which is called\n&gt; by reactor_ode.m), volume change to keep constant pressure is\n&gt; calculated by\n&gt; v = 1.e11 * (pressure(gas) - 101325);\n&gt; The comments specify that this is valid only for 1 atm.  What about\n&gt; isobaric processes at other pressures?  How is the coefficient 1.e11\n&gt; calculated?  Is it a function of pressure?\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor  \n&gt; ---------------------~--&gt;\n&gt; Get A Free Psychic Reading!
