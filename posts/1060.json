(I got similar diagrams when I tried running the \nconverters for different species concentrations)..do we select \nspecies only to include or exclude them from the mechanism path \ndiagram??\n\nFor Example here&#39;s my rxnpath.py file..\n\nfrom Cantera import *\nfrom Cantera import rxnpath\nfrom Cantera.gases import *\n\ngas = Air()\nx = [5] * gas.nSpecies()\ngas.setState_TPX(1800.0, 1.01325e5, x)\n\n#gas = GRI30()\n#gas.set(P = OneAtm, T = 1000.0, X = &#39;O2:1,H:1, H2:1, N2:3.76, \nCH4:1&#39;)\nrxnpath.write(gas, &#39;N&#39;, &#39;tp6.dot&#39;)\nprint &#39;done&#39;\n\n#To convert use command..C:&#92;Program Files&#92;ATT&#92;Graphviz&#92;bin&gt;dot \n-Tgif tp6.dot -o tp6.gif\n\nI got similar results even after I changed [5] to [0.1] in x = \n[5]*gas.nSpecies()\n\nCan anyone help on this??\n\nBhupinder\n\n--\nBhupinder Singh\nDepartment of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering\nUniversity of Florida\nGainesville\n\nPh: 352-392-4442 (O)\n    352-328-4486 (Cell)\n\n\n\n"}}
