It works now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Further question:\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of the reactions in the kinetic\n&gt; scheme are tagged with [options = &#39;duplicate&#39;].\n&gt; These reactions appear twice but with different\n&gt; kinetic parameters. Why is this? When I look\n&gt; at the kinetic scheme (H2-O2-N2-Ar) by Marinov, Westbrook & Pitz,\n&gt; there are no duplicate reactions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Arief\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Arief,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (1) why are there no thermodynamic and reaction\n&gt;&gt;&gt; data in it, as in the case of h2o2.xml?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the file I sent you, I prefaced the species entry\n&gt; with &quot;gri30: &quot;,\n&gt;&gt; and also the reactions entry.  This means that Cantera will look\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; these species / reactions in file gri30.xml, instead of in the\n&gt; local\n&gt;&gt; file.  The gri30.xml file comes with Cantera.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (2) what is the role of the file h2o2.xml? Is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it an output file, or is it being used during the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; flame calculations?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When Cantera reads a .cti input file, it first converts it to\n&gt; another\n&gt;&gt; format and gives it the extension .xml.  The xml file is then read\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; build the objects used in the application program.  You can regard\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; .xml file as an internal intermediate file that you don&#39;t have to\n&gt; worry\n&gt;&gt; about.  Alternatively, once you have created the xml file, you can\n&gt; use\n&gt;&gt; it in place of the cti file in your program.  This is useful if\n&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; want to run Cantera on a machine that does not have Python\n&gt; installed,\n&gt;&gt; since Python is required to do the cti -&gt; xml conversion but not\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; read the xml file.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (3) I modified the file h2o2.cti, such that it contains\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ideal_gas(name = &quot;ohmech&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       elements = &quot; O  H  Ar  N &quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       species = &quot;&quot;&quot; H2  H  O  O2  OH  H2O  HO2  H2O2  AR  N2 &quot;&quot;&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       reactions = &quot;all&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       transport = &quot;Mix&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       initial_state = state(temperature = 300.0,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       pressure = OneAtm)    ).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; However, when I perform the flame calculation I get\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the error message species &quot;N2&quot; unknown. Why do I get\n&gt;&gt;&gt; this error mesage?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Because it is looking for a definition of species &quot;N2&quot; in the\n&gt; local\n&gt;&gt; file, but not finding one.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; PS. To replace AR by N2 I redefined AR in the .cti file,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such that it contains 2 nitrogen atoms and accompanying\n&gt;&gt;&gt; physical data. This seems to work.\n&gt;&gt; That works. Or you can just add a species entry for N2 in addition\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; AR.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
