We had a full house (30+) the entire day.  For \nthose who couldn&#39;t make it, I&#39;ll try to collect together the \npresentations and  post them on the web site.  We agreed to do it again \nin 2 years in Heidelberg, so mark your calendars now.\n\nUnfortunately it appears there is a  problem with the version of \nCantera on the CDs passed out at the workshop, at least if you want to \ntranslate Chemkin-format mechanism files. A bug crept into the \nChemkin-to-Cantera file conversion utility &#39;ck2cti&#39; that I didn&#39;t catch \nbefore we made the CDs.  As a result, the translator reports &#39;syntax \nerrors&#39; in the Chemkin-format file even if it is correct.  (Everything \nshould work fine, however, when using cti input files.)\nThe problem has been fixed and the CVS repository has been updated.\n\nAlso, I have now made a Mac OS X 10.3 binary installer for Cantera and \nwill upload it to sourceforge.  If you have a Mac, you&#39;ll be able to \ninstall a complete version of Cantera, ready to use from Python, \nMatlab, or from your own C++ or Fortran programs, without compiling \nanything.\n\nIt was a pleasure to meet those of you who attended the workshop \nSunday.  If you are here in Chicago this week but didn&#39;t make it to the \nworkshop, catch me if you have Cantera comments, questions, etc.\n\nDave\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n"}}
