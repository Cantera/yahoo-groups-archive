Do you mean t=\r\no \nadd a function to Cantera, which returns a calculated composition \nbased=\r\n on phi such as\nstring mixture_composition(const string& fuel, const string=\r\n& \nOxidizer, double phi) ?\n\nIt is quite easy to implement and I use this fu=\r\nnction in my \ncalculations. Than you can do something like that \n\ndouble T =\r\n=3D 300;\ndouble P =3D 1.0e5;\nstring fuel =3D &quot;CH4:0.8,H2:0.2&quot;;\nstring oxidi=\r\nzer =3D &quot;O2:0.2,N2:0.8&quot;;\ndouble phi =3D 1.0;\ngas.set(T, P, mixture_composit=\r\nion(fuel, oxidizer, phi)); \n\nBest regards, Anatoli\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Dave Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what you=\r\n want to do - what are the data types \nof  \n&gt; things like &quot;CH4:m ole&quot;?
