There is no \nparticular difficulty in doing it for homogeneous mechanisms.  I will \nmake the appropriate modifications later today and update the CVS \nrepository.  I also see that the input file documentation doesn&#39;t even \nmention specifying reaction orders, so I&#39;ll bring it up to date too \nsoon.\n\nAs for the specific points you mention:\n\n1) ck2cti doesn&#39;t support FORD and RORD;  I&#39;ll see if I can easily \nimplement it.\n\n2) you&#39;re right - currently it will read the reaction orders but ignore \nthem for a homogeneous mechanism.\n\n3) Non-unity stoichiometric coefficients should work fine, but this is \ndifferent than specifying reaction orders that do not equal the \nstoichiometric coefficients. If you have a mechanism file where this is \nnot working correctly, please send it to me.\n\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jun 16, 2004, at 11:23 AM, E David Huckaby wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way to introduce arbitrary reaction orders into the\n&gt; kinetic rate expressions ?\n&gt;\n&gt; I tried the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) using the FORD, RORD auxillary keywords in a chemkin input file and\n&gt; using\n&gt; ck2cti to convert the reactions.   ck2cti parses the chemkin input file\n&gt; but does\n&gt; not make in modifications to the description of the reaction in the\n&gt; .cti file\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) manually modify the reaction section of the .cti with the &quot;order&quot;\n&gt; keyword.  This\n&gt; is read into the Cantera succsesfully but the reaction rate values are\n&gt; to small.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also tried specifying a reaction with non-unity stoichmetric\n&gt; coefficients:\n&gt; 2 [A] + 3 [B] -&gt; 1 [C] + 4 [D]\n&gt; which also seemed to foul up the reaction rate calculations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also using non integer stoichmetric coefficients in a chemkin input\n&gt; file\n&gt; or .cti file is flag as invalid by approriate Cantera utility.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any suggestions ?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave Huckaby\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
