For example, I want to use GRI and Air and mix \nthem prior to sending them into a reactor.  What I&#39;m looking for is a \nway to have Cantera (using Python) calculate the combined enthalpies, \ntemperatures, etc. so that the data can be used in our research.  I&#39;m \nfairly new to the system, so I&#39;m not sure if a feature like this has \nbeen implemented yet or not.\n\nAlso, I&#39;ve been having trouble getting to the blue.caltech.edu site.  \nHas it been down for a while, or is the problem on my end?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nGregory A.
