It seems very simple. Unfortunately, I have no clue on how\n&gt; to write a &quot;script&quot; file.

Is it possible?\n&gt; i.e., methane/oxidizer?  Can you give me some directions on the \n&gt; commands.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, where and how would I be able to learn more on the functions and\n&gt; capabilities of Cantera and how to use them?\n&gt;\n&gt; (I managed to fianlly install Cantera on my computer.
