For example, hydrogen (H2) currently \nseems to have a lower limit of 200 K, I need to extend it down to \ncryogenic temperatures (~20 K).\n\nI am getting new polynomial fits to the JANAF data using the &quot;old&quot; 7-\nterm polynomial form for my various gases.  This will satisfy my \nthermodynamic data source requirements.\n\nFor transport properties (viscosity & thermal conductivity), I do \nnot have a complete listing of the various calculational forms used \nin CANTERA.  If I did, I would be able to fit low-temperature \nliterature data and extract the best &quot;diam&quot; and &quot;well_depth&quot; \ncoefficients.  \n\nAs an alternative, I was going to use MATLAB to do a least-squares \nfit to literature data, and determine the best diam and well_depth \ncoefficients without needing to know the exact form of the viscosity \n& thermal conductivity calculations.  However, as I was trying to \nfind a starting point for this procedure, I was manually varying \nCANTERA&#39;s diam and well_depth coefficients, and found that I cannot \nget a viscosity for temperatures below 60K, and I cannot get a \nthermal conductivity below 100 K!  This is regardless of how small I \nmake diam, and regardless of how large I make well_depth.\n\nThe error message I get for H2 viscosity below 60 K is (diam = 0.1 \nand well_depth = 2, vs the default of diam = 2.92 and well_depth = \n38.):\n\n===begin===\n\n??? &lt;no Cantera error&gt;\n\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;ctmethods.dll\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;private&#92;trans_get.m\nOn line 5  ==&gt;   v = ctmethods(50, n, job);\n\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;viscosity.m\nOn line 2  ==&gt; v = trans_get(a.id, 1);\n\n\n====end====\n\nThe error message I get for thermal conductivity below 100 K is:\n\n===begin===\n\n??? &lt;no Cantera error&gt;\n\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;ctmethods.dll\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;private&#92;trans_get.m\nOn line 5  ==&gt;   v = ctmethods(50, n, job);\n\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;thermalConductivity.m\nOn line 3  ==&gt; v = trans_get(a.id, 2);\n\n====end====\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Re: my errors below 60 or 100 K, is there a built-in lower limit \nin CANTERA&#39;s transport properties that has to be removed?  Or some \nother way I can force it to go down to ~20 K?\n\n2.  Are CANTERA&#39;s calculational methods for viscosity & thermal \nconductivity (both pure components & mixtures) detailed in a \nreference? (Is it &quot;Marerro and Mason, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, vol. \n1, p. 3 (1972)&quot; [in TransportFactory.cpp] for pure components; and \nis it &quot;Dixon-Lewis (1968) and Kee, Coltrin, and Glarborg (2002)&quot; [in \ntut6.m] for multicomponent or mixture-averaged models?)  I&#39;ve \nstarted looking at CANTERA&#39;s source code . . . found the collision \nintegrals . . . and I hope that a summary might be available, to \ninsure that I get it right.\n\nTIA,\n\n--Keith\n\n\n\n\n"}}
