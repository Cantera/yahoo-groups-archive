In the program we\n&gt; set the\n&gt; &gt; temperature to 1001K and Pressure to OneAtm and\n&gt; also specify the\n&gt; &gt; number of moles of H2:2, O2:1, N2:4. After this\n&gt; the gas is inserted\n&gt; &gt; in the reactor and a simulation is carried out. My\n&gt; question is the\n&gt; &gt; reactor volume is given a default value of 1m3 at\n&gt; the beginning of\n&gt; &gt; the simulation. My question is when we have set\n&gt; the temperature,\n&gt; &gt; pressure and number of moles inserted in the\n&gt; reactor, shouldnt the\n&gt; &gt; reactor have a volume different from the default\n&gt; value of 1m3?\n&gt; &gt; (approximately the value obtained from the ideal\n&gt; gas formula?)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Surinder\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
