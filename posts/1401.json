It \n&gt; should be=\r\n possible to do the same thing in Matlab.\n&gt; \n&gt; To use this script, there is=\r\n one small thing that has to be changed in \n&gt; the XML file. You need to rem=\r\nove the last comma from each &#39;floatArray&#39; \n&gt; XML element containing the NAS=\r\nA coefficients. I will fix the code that \n&gt; generates these files, so that =\r\nin the future these trailing commas will \n&gt; not be written.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Goodw=\r\nin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Saturday, October 25, 2003, at 05:00 AM, woskimi =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hallo Dave,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am trying to extract the NASA coefficie=\r\nnts from the xml source file\n&gt; &gt; of one gas solution object, like gri30.xml=\r\n.
