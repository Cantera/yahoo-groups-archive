I have started by following the example given in \nthe Cante=\r\nra pdf file. It consists of air, fuel and igniter reservoirs, \nmass flow co=\r\nntroller, combustor, valve (to regulate the pressure) and \nexhaust reservoi=\r\nr that are brought together in the reactor network. \nBut I don&#39;t quiet unde=\r\nrstand why it is necessary to use valve \ncontroller to regulate the pressur=\r\ne after the reactor and before tha \nexhaust reservoir; because in the CSTR =\r\nthe pressure supposed to be \nconstant. Another issue I am dealing with is t=\r\nhe valve itself. The \ntotal massflow rate going trough the valve at the exh=\r\naust is not the \nsame as the one going into the combustor and also there is=\r\n a time lag \nbetween tha peak massflow rates at two mentioned stations.Is i=\r\nt \nbecause of closed loop controller properties (like tolerance or gain \nor=\r\n ...)and if that is the case is there any way to fix it?\nAny answer or comm=\r\nent is greately appreciated.\n\nThanks\nReza Rezvani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
