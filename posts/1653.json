But i am confused. I don&#39;t \n&gt; know=\r\n whether i should install source file through VC++.Net? There i \n&gt; several =\r\nfiles at &quot;Cantera&#92;fortran&#92;src&quot;! which file shall i deal with \n&gt; and how? I =\r\nwould be very very thankful if anybody could give me a \nstep \n&gt; by step pro=\r\ncedure!\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Hesam\n&gt;\nHi Hesam,\n\nI use Visual Studio .NET 2003 and t=\r\nhe Intel Fortran compiler 9.1.  I \njust finished a project where my colleag=\r\nue was still using DEC Fortran \n5.0.  This caused a problem.  I could not s=\r\nend him .lib files because \nMicrosoft has changed the library file format. =\r\n THe older linker that \ncomes with the DEC compiler could not understand th=\r\ne new format.  So if \nyou are trying to use VC++ .NET and Compaq Fortran 6.=\r\nX you will not be \nable to link your Fortran application.  I was able to ge=\r\nt around this \nproblem by doing all the reaction kinetics coding in C++, cr=\r\neating a \nDLL that exposed a few functions to Fortran and building a .lib f=\r\nile \nfor DEC Fortran from a manually created .DEF file.  However here is a =\r\n\nmore detailed procedure if you have a .NET compatible Fortran compiler.\n\nU=\r\nnpack the source files.  \nIn Visual Studio (C++) .NET\nCreate a new solution=\r\n.  I put it in the win32/vc7 directory and named \nit ct_fortran.\nAdd a new =\r\nproject to the solution for the C/C++ files (I called mine \nct_forc), C++, =\r\nWin32 project.  Under application settings select Static \nlibrary and desel=\r\nect precompiled header option.  The C/C++ runtime \nlibraries should be chan=\r\nged to Multithread DLL.  Setup the include \npaths for your Cantera version.=\r\n  I&#39;m using 1.7.1 so they \nwere &#39;../../../../Cantera/src/base&#39; etc.  Add th=\r\ne cpp file as source \nmodules and the h as headers to the project and build=\r\n.\n\nFor the Fortran files you need another project (.NET does NOT allow you =\r\n\nto mix languages).  I called this one ct_for.  Add the .f90 code files \nto=\r\n that project source and build.  \n\nYou can then copy the 2 .lib files produ=\r\nced and the Cantera.mod to the \nlibrary directory from your install.  \n\nHop=\r\ne this helps\nBert\n\n\n\n\n"}}
