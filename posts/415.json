I had already implemented everything \nneeded, except that the reaction orders specified in the input file \nwere being ignored when building the mechanism object.  It is now \nfixed, and I have tested it to verify that it is working, using the \nattached cti file and python script. The CVS repository is now updated; \ndo you need it in any other form? I have not yet looked at adding \n&#39;FORD&#39; to ck2cti.\n\nFor your mechanism,  set the stoichiometric coefficients so they are \nall integers.  Then divide the A parameter by whatever factor (e.g. 2) \nyou multiplied the stoichiometric coefficients by, and specify the \nreaction orders for all reactants.  If you do this, Cantera and Chemkin \nshould give the same results for these reactions with non-integral \norders.\n\nNote that Cantera allows specifying reaction orders ONLY for \nirreversible reactions, so you will need to split your second reaction \ninto 2 irreversible reactions first.  It is definitely not correct \nthermodynamically to compute reverse rate coefficients from microscopic \nreversibility if the reaction orders differ from the stoichiometric \ncoefficients.  This only works if the kinetic rate law has the same \nfunctional form as the equilibrium constant - i.e. mass-action \nkinetics.  I don&#39;t know why Chemkin allows this - it can lead to \nsubtle, hard-to-catch internal inconsistencies.  If you do specify a \nChemkin reaction this way, you will find that the net rate of progress \nis not zero in states of chemical equilibrium; and therefore \nmicroscopic reversibility is violated.  To help you stay on the right \nside of the Laws of Thermodynamics, Cantera only allows reversible \nreactions to have mass-action kinetics.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any problems.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jun 16, 2004, at 1:54 PM, E David Huckaby wrote:\n\n&gt; Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have attached a few version of the mechanism\n&gt; in various file formats.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave H.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dgoodwin@... 6/16/2004 3:16:59 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt; Non-integer reaction orders are currently supported for surface\n&gt; reaction mechanisms, but not for homogeneous mechanisms.  There is no\n&gt; particular difficulty in doing it for homogeneous mechanisms.  I will\n&gt; make the appropriate modifications later today and update the CVS\n&gt; repository.  I also see that the input file documentation doesn&#39;t even\n&gt;\n&gt; mention specifying reaction orders, so I&#39;ll bring it up to date too\n&gt; soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for the specific points you mention:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) ck2cti doesn&#39;t support FORD and RORD;  I&#39;ll see if I can easily\n&gt; implement it.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) you&#39;re right - currently it will read the reaction orders but ignore\n&gt;\n&gt; them for a homogeneous mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Non-unity stoichiometric coefficients should work fine, but this is\n&gt;\n&gt; different than specifying reaction orders that do not equal the\n&gt; stoichiometric coefficients. If you have a mechanism file where this is\n&gt;\n&gt; not working correctly, please send it to me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jun 16, 2004, at 11:23 AM, E David Huckaby wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is there a way to introduce arbitrary reaction orders into the\n&gt;&gt; kinetic rate expressions ?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I tried the following:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1) using the FORD, RORD auxillary keywords in a chemkin input file\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; using\n&gt;&gt; ck2cti to convert the reactions.   ck2cti parses the chemkin input\n&gt; file\n&gt;&gt; but does\n&gt;&gt; not make in modifications to the description of the reaction in the\n&gt;&gt; .cti file\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2) manually modify the reaction section of the .cti with the &quot;order&quot;\n&gt;&gt; keyword.
