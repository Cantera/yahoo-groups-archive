At the momoment I am \ncalculating th=\r\ne heat flux from the T-gradient and the thermal \nconductivity near the non-=\r\nreacting wall, however,this is not too \naccurate, since the last point befo=\r\nre the wall is not near enough to \nthe wall. I also tried to evaluate the e=\r\nnthalpy change of the gas \nnear the wall, but again I have the same problem=\r\n. If &#39;slope&#39; is \nreduced, \nthe calculation is quite time consuming...\n\nIs i=\r\nt possible to fix only one single point of the grid (perhaps 1 \nmicron from=\r\n the wall or so), to overcome this problem? Or is there \neven an easier way=\r\n to get the heat flux?\n\nCan anybody help me?\nThank you!\n\nRegards,\nBurak Ata=\r\nkan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
