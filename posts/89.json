The work will involve developing methods to \nextract reduced reaction mechanisms for energetic materials directly \nfrom reactive molecular dynamics simulation data, and will involve \nworking closely with the Goddard group.\n\nThe position is available immediately. Unfortunately this is a short-\nduration program, and will likely end at the end of July, 2003.\n\nIf you are interested in spending half a year or so at Caltech, and \nhave experience in kinetics, computational methods, etc., please let \nme know off-line (dgoodwin@...) and I can provide more \ninformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
