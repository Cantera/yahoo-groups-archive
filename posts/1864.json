(The main\nreason is that I can run off a widely unmaintained Cantera installation\non our server.)\n\nNow I&#39;ve run into the issue that I cannot overload\nDomain1D::initTimeInteg (in File Domain1D.h), as it is not declared\nvirtual. Making this routine overloadable would not change the\nperformance of the code and help me (and others) use this great software\npackage even better.\n\nRegards,\n-Ingmar-\n\nPS: On that note I&#39;d also like to point out that StFlow::componentIndex\n(in file StFlow.h/cpp) is obsolete, and currently not even called, as\nthe base class routine is not overloaded correctly.\n\n\n"}}
