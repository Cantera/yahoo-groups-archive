Unlike conventional\ncontrolled combustion in a rocket engine combustion chamber, the abort\nmode ruptures the propellant tanks and leads to incomplete mixing and\npartial combustion of the fuels and oxidizers.  I&#39;m interested in\nsimulating both hypergolic propellants and hydrocarbon + LOX\ncombinations.  To date I have been applying an equilibrium combustion\nanalysis to an assumed fraction of the fuel+oxidizer mixture and then\nadding supplemental reactions to represent thermal decomposition and\nvaporization of the residual &quot;unreacted&quot; propellant that are added to\nthe combustion model products. I have to then evaluate the\nthermodynamic state of the mixture in order to compute an average\nfireball temperature and heat content.  The heat content drives the\nbouyancy of the propellant exhaust cloud which is then embedded into\nan atmopsheric physics model to compute downwind transport and\ndiffusion.  This problem is of interest because the unreacted\npropellants are often toxic at even low concentrations.  Any insights\nor opinions on how (or if) Cantera might be applied to such a problem?\n\nRandy Nyman, P.E.\nACTA Inc.\nVandenberg AFB\n\n \n\n\n"}}
