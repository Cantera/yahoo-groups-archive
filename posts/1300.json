But then, further on,\n&gt; the latter variable is used in an if statement with test -n:\n&gt;\n&gt; if test -n ${BUILD_F90}; then\n&gt;\n&gt; which will always result in true. If I&#39;m not mistaken, it should read\n&gt;\n&gt; if [ $BUILD_F90 = 1 ]; then\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This concerns the source package of version 1.6.0.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
