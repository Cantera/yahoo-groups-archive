I j=\r\nust  \ninstalled Cantera on a PC running Windows XP Home Edition and MixMast=\r\ner  \nran.  You need to of course first run the Cantera Python installer  \nw=\r\nithin the folder that running Cantera15.msi creates, but I assume you  \ndid=\r\n that.  As far as a graphical interface, MixMaster is the only  \ngraphical =\r\nCantera application. The other Python demos are most  \nconveniently run fro=\r\nm IDLE. (Right-click on the icon, and select &#39;Edit  \nwith IDLE&#39;.)\n\n  For MA=\r\nTLAB, I suspect that it is a version problem.  It looks like you  \nare usin=\r\ng MATLAB 5.3, but version 6.5 is needed. Does anyone else have  \nexperience=\r\n running Cantera from the Student Edition of MATLAB?\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, =\r\nSeptember 18, 2003, at 02:18 PM, hendersonsjh wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; I&#39;m a graduat=\r\ne student from Wright State Univerisity in Dayton, Ohio\n&gt; and i&#39;m having di=\r\nffuculty on installing the most recent version of\n&gt; Cantera on Windows XP. =\r\n I followed the instruction given in the\n&gt; powerpoint file: cantera15-insta=\r\nll, using the the cantera15.msi\n&gt; installer.  It seems that none of the fil=\r\nes for Mixmaster are being\n&gt; installed.  When i run some of the examples us=\r\ning Python it seems\n&gt; that these examples are working but there seems to be=\r\n no graphical\n&gt; interface.  Also i want to use Matlab to run Cantera and no=\r\nne of the\n&gt; tutorial or examples file run.  Using the Matlab tutorial tut2.=\r\nm I\n&gt; get the following errors:\n&gt;\n&gt; EDU=BB tut2\n&gt; ???
