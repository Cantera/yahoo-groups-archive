See, for \n&gt; example, the Cantera MATLAB demos &quot;ignite.m&quot;, &quot;ignite2.m&quot;, an=\r\nd the \n&gt; function in the Cantera toolbox &quot;reactor_ode.m&quot; for an example of =\r\nthis \n&gt; approach. The MATLAB stiff ODE integrator used in these demos works=\r\n \n&gt; fine for these problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have actually written a new class &quot;Flow=\r\nReactor&quot; that is closer to \n&gt; what you want, but it is not ready for releas=\r\ne yet.   It is designed to \n&gt; simulate reacting plug flow in a channel, and=\r\n includes compressibility \n&gt; effects, heat loss, friction, etc.  I&#39;ll make =\r\nsure to allow specified \n&gt; T(x) and P(x) as an option.
