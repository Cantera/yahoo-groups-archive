Neither \npropan=\r\ne nor butane is present due to 100% conversion or combustion. \nNow I have 2=\r\n problems which I cannot overcome. If anyone can help me \nI would be thankf=\r\nul.\n1) the most important one - I guess- I have to add reactions to \nGRI30.=\r\n In my system I have 9 reactions. \nI want to add them to .cti file but I ca=\r\nnnot understand what are the \nnumbers in the barckets and what are their un=\r\nits like  \n#  Reaction 53\nreaction( &quot;H + CH4 &lt;=3D&gt; CH3 + H2&quot;,   [6.60000E+0=\r\n8, 1.62, 10840]). In \naddition , must all of the reactions be equilibrium r=\r\neactions.  \n2) similarly, while adding C4H10 to the library, what data shou=\r\nld I \nsupply and -in order to be consistent-\nwhere can I find these data?\n\n=\r\nThank you in advance,\n\nFeyza Gokaliler, M.Sc.\nChemical Engineering Departme=\r\nnt, Bogazici University\nIstanbul, Turkey\nfeyza.gokaliler@...\n\n\n\n"}}
