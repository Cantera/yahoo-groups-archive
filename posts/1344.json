From my\nknowledge o=\r\nf mass balancing the initial concentration must be 0 for\nwater, and the con=\r\ncentrations at z=3D0 unequal to zero should be only\nthose of the educts hyd=\r\nrogen, oxygen and the inertial gas argon. \nI&#39;ve used the unaltered script f=\r\nlame1.py of cantera-1.6.0, varied only\nthe pressure within 0.03-1 atm. A si=\r\nmilar behaviour is observable for\nCK II running premixed H2-O2-Ar flames or=\r\n C2H2-O2-flames, but this is\nno CK II group, but interesting for me (some f=\r\norm of oo-inheritance?-). \nTextbooks about combustion (Warnatz et al.) show=\r\n graphs with initial\nwater concentrations of zero. \nIs something wrong in m=\r\ny interpretation of the results in flame1.csv? \n\nBest regards from Germany\n=\r\n\nHolger    \n\n\n\n\n"}}
