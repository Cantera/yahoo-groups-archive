I am running a\nsimple equilibrium problem with Ideal gases (and GRI3.0).  I want to\ncompute equilibrium solutions for a range of stoichiometries and\nvarious enthalpies.\n\nAt adiabatic enthalpies, things work fine.  However, as I decrease the\nenthalpy further from the adiabatic value, ChemEquil hangs in\nChemEquil::setInitialMoles inside the call to simplx_.  It gets stuck\nin an infinite loop (the L20-L30 loop).\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nJames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
