The code I would like to set up is very similar to the Flame1 \ndemo.  I would like to replace the &#39;outlet&#39;, which appears to only \nspecify gradients, with something like the reservior, which specifies \na fixed temperature and composition.  Cantera complains that reservoir \nis not a Domain1D object.  What object can I use instead?\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
