For example, in \nmultiphase problems, depending on how the polynomial fits are done for \nthe condensed phases, condensed phases may be computed to be present at \ntemperatures far above their melting or boiling point.  This results \nsimply because the thermo fits for condensed phases are typically done \nonly in the temperature range for which it is thermodynamically stable, \nand the polynomial may be non-monotonic outside this range. The \nmultiphase solver handles this by only allowing condensed phases to \nexist at temperatures for which their thermo data are valid.\n\nOf course if you really want to do a calculation outside the valid \ntemperature range, you can always go in and edit the input cti file to \nchange the temperature limits... Since cti files are really Python \nscripts, it is possible to set the temperature limits for species to \nsymbolic values (e.g. TMIN or TMAX), and then near the top of the cti \nfile add a line like:\n\nTMAX = 6000.0\n\nto change the max temperature for many species simultaneously.  Of \ncourse, this is much more cumbersome in the old NASA-format 4-line \nthermo data records.  Yet another reason to migrate away from the \nChemkin/NASA file format and use cti format as the primary input \nformat...\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\nOn Jun 3, 2005, at 4:29 PM, jcs6a50 wrote:\n\n&gt; A suggestion for the next release:\n&gt;\n&gt; It may be better to not throw an error on a temperature-specified\n&gt; equilibrium solve if the temperature exceeds the polynomial fit range.\n&gt;  It may be best to go ahead with the solution, and leave it up to the\n&gt; user to check validity of the temperature limits.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; James\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
