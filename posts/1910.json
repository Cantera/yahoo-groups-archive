I want to calculate a\nco=\r\nmbustion with this tool. But i have no idea how to start.\n\nI know how to de=\r\nfine a gas, set the temperature and the pressure,\ndefine the elements. But =\r\ndont know where to define the air/fuel ratio. \nFor example: a combustion wi=\r\nth natural gas and a air\n/fuel ratio (lambda) =3D 1.2\n\nI did such calculati=\r\non with other tools, but i am not sure how i have\nto use this tool.\n\ncould =\r\nsomebody please help me ? does anyone got a good tutorial or\nexample. Maybe=\r\n someone knows a good userguide for this tool.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n"}}
