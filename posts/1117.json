It is available on sourceforge\nhttp://sourcefo=\r\nrge.net/projects/sct-cantera/\n\nsct-Cantera was written specifically to enab=\r\nle keeping track of\nmultiple thermodynamic states. In the original Cantera =\r\npackage, a gas\nmixture is represented by a large programming object in the =\r\ncomputer&#39;s\nmemory. In order to compare thermodynamic properties between sta=\r\ntes, a\nprogrammer had two choices: (1) create multiple gas objects (a time\n=\r\nand resource intensive process) or (2) continually update a single\n&quot;gas obj=\r\nect,&quot; but extract all relevant thermodynamic properties from\neach state and=\r\n store them in separate variables. To enable more\nefficient and readable co=\r\nde, we programmed a set of wrapper functions\ninto the sct-Cantera package.\n=\r\n\nsct-Cantera does add some more functionality.  For example, the MATLAB\nCan=\r\ntera interface is unable to set some combinations of thermodynamic\nproperti=\r\nes but sct-cantera allows this. For example, with sct-Cantera\nthe user can =\r\nsimultaneously set Temperature and Entropy. \n\nThe zip file on sourceforge h=\r\nas been tested with Cantera 1.6\n\nWe welcome thoughts and comments.\n\nRebecca=\r\n Hunt\nStanford University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
