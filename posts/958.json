I tried modelling the fuel as \nCH4:0.9,\nCH3:0.1, H:0.1 to begin a reaction. But I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s \na\nbetter approach for this.\n\nIn the case of my interest, my initial composition consists of a\nmixture of air and fuel diluted by exhaust gases (an over\nsimplified case of exhaust gas recirculation). From some\ncalculations, I set the initial composition of gases. But since\nthe mixture is very dilute, the reaction does not take off even\nwith CH4:0.9, CH3:0.1, H:0.1 and hence I had to raise the initial\ntemperature. I had to put a temperature as high as 1800 to start\nthe reaction and to my surprise, that initial temperature value\ndoesn&#39;t even show up on the plots! I tried changing the time \nscale\nto check if the high initial temperature could be seen, but it \nsurely\ndid not show up in plots.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nBhupinder\n\n--\nBhupinder Singh\nDepartment of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering\nUniversity of Florida\nGainesville\n\nPh: 352-392-4442 (O)\n\n\n"}}
