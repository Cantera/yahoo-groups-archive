You don&#39;t need to compile anything to use it. In fact, \nyou don&#39;t need to program at all, and you don&#39;t need to know the \nPython language. A general-purpose driver script is included that \nallows you to:\n\n- carry out kinetics simulations in adiabatic or isothermal reactors \nat constant pressure or volume\n\n- compute chemical equilibrium\n\n- generate reaction path diagrams (see www.cantera.org for an example)\n\nSimply edit the driver script to set the options and parameter values \nfor your problem, and process it with python.\n\nOf course, if you do know some Python, you can customize this script \nto do other things too. Documentation will be available shortly. In \nthe meantime, take a look at the driver script (driver.py).\n\nGo to www.cantera.org to download the package.\nLet me know if you run into problems.\n\n\n"}}
