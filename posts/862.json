Page 37\nof &#39;cti.pdf&#39; in the cantera documentation explains it better.\n\nJust as an example of how to declare duplicate reactions, this is\nfrom the &#39;ptcombust.cti&#39; file that comes with cantera (though the\nrates aren&#39;t both arrhenius, here):\n\n#  Reaction 4\nsurface_reaction(&quot;O2 + 2 PT(S) =&gt; 2 O(S)&quot;,   \n                  Arrhenius(1.80000E+21, -0.5, 0),\n                  options = &#39;duplicate&#39;)\n\n#  Reaction 5\nsurface_reaction( &quot;O2 + 2 PT(S) =&gt; 2 O(S)&quot;,   \n                  stick(2.30000E-02, 0, 0),\n                  options = &#39;duplicate&#39;)\n\n\nAs an aside, I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a typo in your email, but the\ntwo exponential terms in your email are exactly the same \n{ &quot;exp(+1.629/RT)&quot; }, in which case you could just factor them out to\nget one rate.\n\nRegards,\nSteven\n\n\n\n\n--- aedahoe &lt;ae.dahoe@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Colleagues,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Reaction 15 of Marinov, Westbrook, Pitz scheme\n&gt; has the following expression for the reaction\n&gt; rate: k = 4.2e14*exp(+1.629/RT)+1.30e11*exp(+1.629/RT)\n&gt; \n&gt; How can this be included in the .cti file?\n&gt; \n&gt; With best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Arief\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
