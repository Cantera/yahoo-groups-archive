However, I would prefer to do my\nwo=\r\nrk in Matlab if possible. I was wondering if there was a Matlab\nfunction th=\r\nat can be used in place of the FreeFlame function used in\nthe python exampl=\r\ne? I am new to cantera and was looking to run\ndifferent simulations with th=\r\nis example via matlab if possible.\n\nThank you\n\nChris Kelly\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
