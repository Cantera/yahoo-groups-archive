The one \nimplemented by class ChemEquil.cpp (and the one used by default if you \nuse the &quot;equilibrate&quot; method in Python or MATLAB) uses a form of the \nelement potential method.  There are many variations on this basic \nalgorithm, and the exact details of the ChemEquil algorithm are not \ncurrently described anywhere, but can be deduced by studying the source \ncode in ChemEquil.cpp.\n\nThe other algorithm used is the &quot;VCS&quot; algorithm, which works for \nmulti-phase mixtures with condensed phases (unlike the element \npotential method), but is also slower than the element potential \nmethod.  The implementation of this algorithm is in file \n&quot;MultiPhaseEquil.cpp&quot;.\n\nA good book on equilibrium algorithms is &quot;Chemical Reaction \nEquilibrium&quot; by Smith and Missen.  It is out of print, but perhaps you \ncan find it in your library.  They define 2 classes of equilibrium \nalgorithms - &quot;stoichiometric&quot; and &quot;non-stoichiometric&quot;.  Stoichiometric \nalgorithms search among a set of states that all satisfy the element \nconstraints for the one state that satisfies the conditions of chemical \nequilibrium. Non-stoichiometric algorithms do the opposite: they search \nthrough a set of states that all satisfy the conditions to be valid \nchemical equilibriium states for *some* set of element mole numbers for \nthe one that satisfies the specified element constraints.  Cantera&#39;s \nalgorithm in ChemEquil.cpp is non-stoichiometric; the one (VCS) in \nMultiPhaseEquil.cpp is stoichiometric.  Cantera&#39;s implementation of the \nVCS algorithm follows Smith and Missen fairly closely, but adds a few \nfeatures to handle things like charged species correctly.\n\nDave Goodwin\n\n\n\nOn Aug 1, 2005, at 8:38 AM, se_deferrieres wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Professor Goodwin,\n&gt; I&#39;m writing my MSc report on the calculations I did under Cantera and\n&gt; I&#39;d like to know which method of determining equilibrium Cantera is\n&gt; using.\n&gt; Thanks for your help\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Solene\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
