The\nsetup procedure worked fine and now I am trying to make a few first\nsteps, so I am basically working my way through the C++-documentation. \nWhen using the example-program, I run into problems:\n\nIn Listing 2.1 I had to include &quot;IdealGasMix.h&quot; (which is not done in\nthe Listing), otherwise the compiler did not know the\nIdealGasMix-routine. Furthermore, a call to \n\nIdealGasMix g(fname)\n\n(with fname being &quot;gri30.xml&quot;) will compile, but results in an \nCantera-Error on execution. When changin this line to something \nof the type \n\nIdealGasMix g(&quot;gri30.xml&quot;, &quot;gri30&quot;) \neverything works fine.\nIn Listing 3.1 I have to include &quot;equilibrium.h&quot; in order to get \n\nequilibrate(gas, TP)\n\nto be recognized.\nThe\n\nprintSummary(g,cout)\n\n-Function is do not found at all (and I cant&#39;t find it in the\ncantera-Files either), so the code is not compiled.\n\nWere there a lot of changes in the 1.5 - Version, so that the Listings\ndo not work anymore or is there something wrong in my Installation\n(Paths, Makefile, etc)?\n\nI would be very thankful for any hints, thanks in advance\n\nDaniel Schanz, University of Goettingen\n\n\n"}}
