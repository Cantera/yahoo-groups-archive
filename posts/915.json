As I have discussed before, I am using several nested \nloops to calculate the equilibrium molar mass of a gas mixture, then \nthe time it takes to reach this molar mass, and then store the data \nand start the calculation over at a new initial temperature.  After \nabout 5 temperature increments, equilibrate returns the error:\n\n??? Unexpected Standard exception from MEX file.\nWhat() is:bad allocation\n\n\nError in ==&gt; @ThermoPhase&#92;private&#92;thermo_set at 13\n  i = ctmethods(20, n,-job, a, b, c, d, e);  \n\nError in ==&gt; ThermoPhase.equilibrate at 33\n  iok = thermo_set(a.tp_id, 50, 101, solver, rtol, maxsteps, \nloglevel);\n\nError in ==&gt; reactor1_equilibrium_HP at 44\n   equilibrate(gas,&#39;HP&#39;,1,1.0e-8,1000);\n\n\nI am not quite sure what this means, but I then have to exit Matlab \nand reopen it to avoid the Matlab memory error message followed by a \nrequest to send my error report to the Mathworks support team.\nI have tried to use the cleanup command, but I can&#39;t use the clear \nall command without losing the data I want to store, or resetting \nthe loop variables.  I have tried using cleanup and individually \nclearing all of the variables except for the loop variables and the \none storing my data, but it does not work.  Do you have any \nsuggestions?  Would it be possible in future Cantera releases to \nmodify the cleanup command so that the user can choose which C++ \nCantera objects to delete?  \nThank you very much for any advise you can offer.\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perhaps this is a MATLAB problem. In MATLAB, there is no way that \nI can \n&gt; find to delete the C++ Cantera object when the MATLAB &#39;shadow&#39; \nobject \n&gt; is deleted (cleared).  So if you create lots of Cantera objects in \nthe \n&gt; MATLAB workspace, it can consume memory that is not released even \nif \n&gt; you type &#39;clear all&#39;.  I have provided a function &#39;cleanup&#39; that \n&gt; deletes ALL Cantera objects.  If you use &#39;cleanup&#39;, you must also \nclear \n&gt; all Cantera objects from the MATLAB workspace, since they cannot \nbe \n&gt; used once the underlying C++ objects are deleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or it could be a problem due to using MATLAB 6.5, since the \nWindows \n&gt; Cantera MATLAB toolbox was compiled with MATLAB 7.\n&gt; \n&gt; If MATLAB gives you problems, you could do your calculation in \nPython, \n&gt; which has better capabilities for memory management.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jun 28, 2005, at 9:19 AM, chrtom1979 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Mr Goodwin,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I finally manage to use the mixture equilibrate command (I work \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Matlab6.5 in Windows environment) using Cantera1.6. I work with a\n&gt; &gt; powerful pc desktop (3.4GHz-Cpu, 1024MB-RAM), but I have some \nproblem,\n&gt; &gt; since the model fill up all the memory...\n&gt; &gt; I work with an ideal gas phase and a solid carbon phase, doing \nsome\n&gt; &gt; iteration for several values of temperature and pressure.\n&gt; &gt; I have seen in your Python demo (adiabatic.py) the following \nsyntax:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; mix.equilibrate(&#39;HP&#39;, maxsteps = 1000,err = 1.0e-6, maxiter = \n200,\n&gt; &gt; loglevel=0)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; where you fix the max number of iterations.
