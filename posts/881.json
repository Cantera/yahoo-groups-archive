But can you shortly discribe what does mean energy \non/off, and what influence does have multi component transport on the \nsolution in comparission to non multi transport. \nHow I explained in the first message I would like to calculate \nflamespeeds for n-heptane/air mixtures, what would be the best method \nto use. Can you write some lines of code in Phyton to explain. I guess \nthere are many people who are interested in this ass well.
