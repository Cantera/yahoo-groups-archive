Among other things, it \nintroduces the new capability to simulate steady 1D flames. \nCurrently, burner-stabilized flames are supported; other types will \nbe added very soon. (They are actually already there; only the user \ninterface needs to be cleaned up.)\n\nThe flame solver uses the Python interface, so to do flame \nsimulations you will need to install Python 2.2 if you don&#39;t have it \nalready on your system. Complete instructions on how to do this are \nincluded. (It&#39;s easy.)\n\nThe source distribution now includes the complete MATLAB and Python \ninterface code, in addition to the C++ code, so you can build both \nfrom the source if you like. This has been verified to work using \nWindows and using linux, but should work on any unix-like system. (If \nanyone wants to port Cantera to Mac OS-X, please do so!)\n\nFor Windows users, there is also a binary version, which includes \nboth the MATLAB and Python binary code. If you download this binary \ndistribution, you can use Cantera from Python or MATLAB without \ncompiling anything. \n\nYou can get these files from http://www.cantera.org, as usual. Go \nto &#39;download&#39;, and then select the directory you want. For the source \ndistribution, there is a zip file for PCs, and a tar.gz file for unix.\n\nDocumentation is still sparse, but tutorial scripts for both Python \nand MATLAB are provided that describe most of what you need to know. \nFor flame simulations, see scripts &#39;flame1.py&#39; (a low-pressure \nhydrogen flame) and &#39;flame2.py&#39; (an atmospheric-pressure, rich \nCH4/air flame) in the python &#39;examples&#39; directory.  \n\nPlease let me know if you run into problems installing or running \nthis new version.\n\nDave G.\n\n\n\n"}}
