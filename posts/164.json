I=B4m using Cantera mostly for =\r\nresearch \ncode development using plug-flow-reactors.\n\nMy question is, if it=\r\n is now necessary to define a wall for an \nreactor to set the heat transfer=\r\n to non-adiabatic values? If I use \nthe &quot;setHeatTransferCoeff()&quot;-function f=\r\nor an reactor it doesn=B4t have \nany effect.\n\nAnother question is if you ar=\r\ne planning to implement Sensitivity \nAnalysis. There is an Code &quot;cvodes&quot; fr=\r\nom sundials which offers some \nfunctionality in this direction. If you want=\r\n I will try to implement \nit in cantera on my own and make some suggestions=\r\n how you could make \nit official?\n\nThird question: is it possible to constr=\r\nuct flame between two \nopposing nozzles (like oppdif in CH*MKIN) from the o=\r\nne-dim class?\n\nI hope it isn=B4t to much and look forward to your answers.\n=\r\n\nbest regards\nulf\n\n\n\n\n"}}
