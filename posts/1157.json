I could get the \nlaminar burning veloc=\r\nity of CH4. But I could not get high octane number.\nIn particular, I want t=\r\no calculate the laminar burning velocity of iso-\nC8H18. I already have obta=\r\nined mechanisms of the LLNL combustion group.\n\nDo I need other mechanism fi=\r\nles or technique?\nI would like to know if anyone has been successful.\n\nThan=\r\nk you very much.\n\nAtatera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
