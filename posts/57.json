Let me know if you have opinions about the reaction rate \nformalism, support for coverage dependent rates, or anything else. \n\nSecond, I wanted to give you a &#39;heads up&#39; about what is coming soon. \nWithin a couple of weeks I will be releasing a new Python version, \nand new one-dimensional reacting-flow models. With these you will be \nable to simulate\n\n- flat premixed flames\n- counterflow flames\n- stagnation flows with surface chemistry\n\n\nFor a preview, see http://blue.caltech.edu/flame.ppt\nThis image shows two premixed, 1 atm, stoichiometric methane/air \nflames with different flowrates separated by 1 cm in a counterflow \ngeometry. Velocity streamlines and CH are shown. This computation was \ndone with GRI-Mech 3.0, and includes solving the energy equation. The \nfinal grid contained 70 or so points. It ran in a couple of minutes \non a laptop.\n\nAnyway, this should be out in a couple of weeks at the latest...\n\nDave\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}}
