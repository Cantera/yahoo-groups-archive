You are now deep into uncharted \nCantera territory...  Of course, Cantera can do this, and I use it for \nthis in SOFC simulations. But I haven&#39;t written anything up about how \nto do it. It sounds like you&#39;re figuring it out though.\n\nA few points:\n\n1.  Use &quot;incompressible_solid&quot; instead of &quot;stoichiometric_solid&quot; if you \nwant to have multiple bulk species. If you specify a stoichiometric \nsolid, then the activity is always 1.0 in computing reaction rates, \nunlike an &quot;incompressible_solid&quot;, where the activity is the mole \nfraction.\n\nBut note also that in an electrolyte like YSZ, the vacancy \nconcentration is very nearly constant, since it must compensate the \nexcess negative charge due to the immobile Y atoms on the Zr sites (+3 \ninstead of +4 valence).  If the vacancy concentration were to deviate \nmore than a very small amount from 0.5 * (Y concentration) then there \nwould be a net space charge and big internal electric fields, which \nwould cause the vacancies to move until they just compensate the Y \ncharge.  So as a result, the vacancy concentration is essentially fixed \nby the Y doping level, and is not really variable.\n\n2.  To simulate a metal electrode, use entry type &quot;metal&quot; in the cti \nfile. The only species needed is an electron, since this is the only \nbulk metal species that participates in the chemistry.  As with \n&quot;stoichiometric_solid&quot;, &quot;metal&quot; assigns unit activity to the electron \nspecies, so the reaction rate does not depend on any &quot;concentration&quot; of \nelectrons.\n\nFor example, here&#39;s my definition of &quot;nickel&quot;:\n\nmetal(name = &quot;nickel&quot;,\n       elements = &quot;E&quot;,\n       species = &quot;e_Ni&quot;,\n       density = (8.908, &#39;kg/m3&#39;),\n       initial_state = state( temperature =tt, mole_fractions = \n&#39;e_Ni:1.0&#39;))\n\nspecies( name = &quot;e_Ni&quot;,   atoms = &quot;E:1&quot;,\n         thermo = const_cp(h0 = (0.0, &#39;kcal/mol&#39;)))\n\n\n3.  You can set each phase to a different potential, and reactions that \ntransfer net charge across an interface will have their activation \nenergies modified by the potential difference. By default the symmetry \nparameter beta = 0.5, but other values can be specified.\n\nAs it turns out, I am working on writing up some examples of \nelectrochemical calculations with Cantera.  I&#39;ll give you a copy of \nwhat I write in a couple of weeks.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jun 6, 2005, at 12:48 PM, DeCal_12 wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to incorporate three-phase-boundary reactions into a\n&gt; numerical simulation of a solid oxide fuel cell.  I am using cantera\n&gt; primarily for kinetics and thermo calculations.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a couple questions about handling bulk phases.  So far I&#39;ve\n&gt; defined an interface with a gas phase, several adsorbed surface\n&gt; species, and two bulk phases (one for oxide ions in the electrolyte,\n&gt; and one for oxide vacancies in the electrolyte).  My questions are:\n&gt;\n&gt; -is there any way to combine the two bulk phases into one phase?\n&gt; Creating a stoichiometric solid seems to only allow one species.\n&gt;\n&gt; -for reactions involving the oxide ions or vacancies in the\n&gt; electrolyte, the rates should obviously depend on the concentrations\n&gt; of said species.  How can this concentration be changed?  I&#39;ve tried\n&gt; changing the phase density, both in the cti file and\n&gt; through &#39;setDensity&#39; in the Matlab interface, but the results of the\n&gt; call to &#39;netprodrates(interface)&#39; remain unchanged.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can anyone please help?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Steven DeCaluwe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
