Also within subfunction like &quot;fsolve&quot; where the s=\r\nolution \nvariable is one of the input variables.\nIf I start MATLAB and run =\r\nthe code a few times I always get this \nsegmentation violation error somewh=\r\nere within the ctmethods mex-\nfunction; but not always at the same call of =\r\nequilibrate!! After some \nruns (not always the same number) my code works.\n=\r\nI guess that while using the cantera there&#39;s &quot;something&quot; loaded into \nmemor=\r\ny which remains there; making my code work after several calls.\n\nI&#39;ve tried=\r\n to initialize the solution variables with &quot;GRI30&quot; as well \nas with &quot;import=\r\nPhase&quot;.\nI&#39;ve tried &quot;cleanup&quot; after each subfunction.\nI&#39;ve tried equilibrate=\r\n(gas,&#39;TP&#39;,1) to use the new solver.\nI&#39;ve tried several different code struc=\r\ntures\n\nBut basically I always get the same error.\n\nDoes anybody know how to=\r\n load and unload cantera related &quot;stuff&quot; \nwithin subfunctions of big MATLAB=\r\n codes in a definte way?\n\nHas anybody got similiar problems and solved it?\n=\r\n\nCould there be a problem with a lot of calls in a row \nof &quot;equilibrate&quot; (t=\r\nhousands of calls within optimizer loops)?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nTom\n\np.s.: j=\r\nust a tip: \nI&#39;ve recognized a &quot;pointer like&quot; behaviour of solution variable=\r\ns in \nMATLAB.\nif you do something like:\ng1=3DGRI30;\ng2=3Dg1;\nset(g1,&#39;T&#39;,400=\r\n);\nThe set command will have effect on BOTH variables g1 and g2!!!! \n\n\n\n"}}
