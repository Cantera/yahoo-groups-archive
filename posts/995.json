I need to know the thermal conductivity at each grid \npoint.  The command, thermalConductivity(gas) returns the thermal \nconductivity of the gas at the final grid point.  The command, solution\n(fl, &#39;flow&#39;, thermalConductivity(gas)) returns a list containing the \ncorrect number of entries, but they are not even close to the correct \nvalues (the first point is 500, and most of the rest are 0).  My \nultimate goal is to write a csv file containing the velocity, \ntemperature, and thermal conductivity profiles.  This is easy on \nPython, but I still have not figured out how to import solutions into \npython to use as an initial guess.  Does anyone know how to get the \nthermal conductivity at each grid point in Matlab, or how to import \nsolutions as initial guesses in Python?  \n\nThank you very much for any help you can offer.\n\nJeff Miller\n\nColorado School of Mines Engineering\n\n\n\n"}}
