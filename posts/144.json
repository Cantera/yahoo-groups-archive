I believe I must have missed something basic during Cantera\ninstallation, otherwise more people would be having this problem. I\ncannot access any of the transport properties through Cantera. Typical\ncommand line prompts as follows:\n\ngas = GRI30;\nviscosity(gas)\n\n??? Undefined function or variable &#39;getCanteraError&#39;.\n\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;documents and settings&#92;mm&#92;my\ndocuments&#92;cantera-1.3&#92;cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;viscosity.m\nOn line 4  ==&gt;    error(getCanteraError);\n\nSimilar errors occur for all other transport properties.\n\n2). I also found what seems to be an obvious error in the m-file code\nfor setState_HP.m. After my installation of the matlab toolbox, this\nfile had the following line in it:\n\nh, p = hp;\n\nwhich is simply improper syntax for matlab. In fact, the line wasn&#39;t\nreally necessary, and removing the line and slightly modifying the\nnext allowed the setState_HP command to properly function. I&#39;m\nconfused/concerned that my installation seems to be the only one with\nsuch an error. Has this been seen before?\n\nAny assistance you can provide will be appreciated. I am using Cantera\nv. 1.3; I installed the Matlab toolbox in March, 2003.\n\n\n"}}
