Fuels are from methane to ben=\r\nzene,\nlow-p to atmospheric, simulated with a few detailed kinetic models fr=\r\nom the\nliterature and with two of my own, ranging from 100 to 1200 reaction=\r\ns. (200\nor so runs in total). All the flames have temperature profile from =\r\nthe\nexperiment. That&#39;s kind of a lot for the e-mail attachment.\n\nFor about =\r\na third of those runs I have cantera solution as well, all with\nmulticompon=\r\nent diffusion. Differences between cantera and CK Premix\nsolutions are  in =\r\nmost cases negligible. In few cases I examined in detail,\nthe differences o=\r\nriginate from your improvenments in diffusion formulation.\n\nTo my experienc=\r\ne, Cantera (my Python premixed script) handles many a case on\nwhich CK Prem=\r\nix gives up, but I have a handfull of cases that neither code\ncould find a =\r\nsolution for.\n\nWhich address would you like the stuff sent to? I e-mailed y=\r\nou one of my\npremixed Python/Cantera scripts to &#39;dgoodwin@...&#39; on M=\r\nay 11, but I\nnever heard back from you...\n\nSincerely,\n            Zoran\n\n\n\n=\r\nI am interested in doing some validation tests of the flame models in \nCant=\r\nera, and would like to ask the assistance of anyone who routinely \nruns fla=\r\nme simulations with the Chemkin version 2 codes PREMIX and/or \nOPPDIFF.  Wh=\r\nat I am looking for are any converged, resolved flame \nsolutions from Chemk=\r\nin 2, including:\n\n1) PREMIX or OPPDIFF input files\n2) reaction mechanism an=\r\nd thermo data files in Chemkin format\n3) computed species and temperature p=\r\nrofiles in some text file format\n\nI am particularly interested in non-trivi=\r\nal flames with large \nmechanisms or at atmospheric pressure or above (but a=\r\nny flame is \nuseful).  I would also like to have examples both with mixture=\r\n-averaged \nand multicomponent diffusion.  If you have this information for =\r\nsome \nflame or flames, please send me a tar or zip file with the files list=\r\ned \nabove.  I will take this information, generate the corresponding \nCante=\r\nra input files + python script, and compare the computed profiles \n(unless =\r\nyou want to do that too...).  I would plan on then sending back \nto you the=\r\n Cantera files, so that you could run a Cantera vs. Chemkin 2 \ntiming compa=\r\nrison on the same machine.\n\nBased on previous comparisons of thermo propert=\r\nies, transport \nproperties, and kinetic rates, I fully expect excellent agr=\r\neement in \nthe steady-state flame profiles, with substantial improvement in=\r\n \nperformance.  But a head-to-head flame comparison would be very \ninterest=\r\ning, and would provide assurance to users converting from the \nChemkin 2 co=\r\ndes that Cantera produces the same output, given the same \ninput.\n\nThis wil=\r\nl be most useful if we can get at least several flames from \ndifferent grou=\r\nps, running on different machines, etc.\nIf you have been wanting to contrib=\r\nute to the development of Cantera \nand its acceptance by the combustion com=\r\nmunity, but aren&#39;t an expert in \nC++/Python, etc., here&#39;s a good opportunit=\r\ny to do so!\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
