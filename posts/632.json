Thank you so much!\n&gt;\n&gt;   I tested this on a XP machine without Fortran using VStudio .Net and\n&gt; was able to run the matlab and python example scripts.  So far I have\n&gt; only tested the zipped source code, and not tested the procedure with\n&gt; code checked out of CVS.\n&gt;\n&gt; I encountered two problems, which I will document here and describe my\n&gt; quick fixes (better solutions are welcomed.)\n&gt; 1. PROBLEM: The first problem occurred at the step of building\n&gt; setup_cantera I get the following output\n&gt; ----------------snip -------------------\n&gt; ------ Starting pre-build validation for project &#39;SetupCantera&#39; ------\n&gt; ERROR: Unable to find source file\n&gt; &#39;cantera-1.5.5&#92;Cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#92;Root&#39; for\n&gt; file &#39;Root&#39;, located in\n&gt; &#39;[TARGETDIR]&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#39;, the file \n&gt; may\n&gt; be absent or locked.\n&gt; ERROR: Unable to find source file\n&gt; &#39;cantera-1.5.5&#92;Cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#92;Repository&#39;\n&gt; for file &#39;Repository&#39;, located in\n&gt; &#39;[TARGETDIR]&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#39;, the file \n&gt; may\n&gt; be absent or locked.\n&gt; ERROR: Unable to find source file\n&gt; &#39;cantera-1.5.5&#92;Cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#92;Entries&#39; \n&gt; for\n&gt; file &#39;Entries&#39;, located in\n&gt; &#39;[TARGETDIR]&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#39;, the file \n&gt; may\n&gt; be absent or locked.\n&gt; ------ Pre-build validation for project &#39;SetupCantera&#39; completed ------\n&gt; ------ Build started: Project: SetupCantera, Configuration: Release \n&gt; ------\n&gt; ------------------------------------ end snip \n&gt; ---------------------------\n&gt; SOLUTION:  My solution was to edit SetupCantera.vdproj in a text \n&gt; editor,\n&gt; removing all sections referring to the CVS directories by hand.  I&#39;m \n&gt; not\n&gt; very familiar with VStudio .NEt yet, so if there is a better way to \n&gt; edit\n&gt; this file,  let me know.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.  PROBLEM: The second small error occurs when running the script\n&gt; run_examples.m in matlab.  Everything seems to be going fin until\n&gt; PRANDTL2 dies with something like:\n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt;                 Cantera Error!\n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt; Procedure: equilibrate\n&gt; Error:   Jacobian is singular.\n&gt; Try adding more species, changing the elemental composition slightly,\n&gt; or removing unused elements.\n&gt;\n&gt; SOLUTION:  This is  *not* an indication of a bad build.  This only\n&gt; happens when PRANDTL2 is run with a variable directly after PRANDTL1,\n&gt; without resetting the variable g.  Insert something like &quot;g=0;&quot; into\n&gt; line 26 of run_examples.m and it will run beautifully.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; David Goodwin wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have just changed the Cantera version number to 1.5.5, and posted a\n&gt;&gt; Windows source distribution at the sourceforge site\n&gt;&gt; (cantera-1.5.5-src.zip).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The big news: Cantera can now be completely built  from within Visual\n&gt;&gt; Studio .NET, including the Python and MATLAB interfaces.  You can also\n&gt;&gt; create your own binary installer programs (.msi files) and distribute\n&gt;&gt; them to install Cantera (+ your own application code) on machines that\n&gt;&gt; do not have Visual Studio.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now there is no need to have cygwin (but personally I would install it\n&gt;&gt; anyway), or to do anything from a command line, or to have Fortran.  I\n&gt;&gt; think virtually all Windows installation problems should be gone now.\n&gt;&gt; (Also, the Python location is no longer hard-wired to C:&#92;PYTHON23.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The procedure is described step-by-step in a Powerpoint presentation I\n&gt;&gt; have also posted at the Sourceforge site under &quot;Cantera Documentation&quot;\n&gt;&gt; - see file cantera-vc7.ppt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Other than that, you may notice a new class &quot;Mixture&quot; in Python, and a\n&gt;&gt; couple of new classes (MultiPhase and MultiPhaseEquil) in C++. These\n&gt;&gt; implement multi-phase mixtures and a new multi-phase equilibrium\n&gt;&gt; solver.  It is fully functional in Python and C++ now (MATLAB soon),\n&gt;&gt; but is not documented, so its official introduction will be in Cantera\n&gt;&gt; 1.6 which will be out in January.  Cantera 1.6 will contain also some\n&gt;&gt; new phase models, and some improved support for non-ideal phases.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Windows people in particular - if you have Visual C++ .NET, please try\n&gt;&gt; out the new build procedure, and report any problems.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
