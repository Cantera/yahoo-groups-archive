It \ncurrently uses a year-old version of Cantera with =\r\na few modifications. A few weeks ago, I \nupdated to the most recent version=\r\n of Cantera from CVS. This new version fails in the \nReactorNet&#39;s advance()=\r\n method with the following error:\n\nCVode-- At t=3D0.000313532, mxstep=3D200=\r\n00 steps taken on this call before reaching \ntout=3D0.00032.\n\n*************=\r\n***********************************\n                   Cantera Error!      =\r\n            \n************************************************\nProcedure: CV=\r\nodeInt\nError:      CVode error encountered.\n\nI have been able to track the =\r\nproblem through the CVode() function into ReactorNet&#39;s eval() \nmethod, but =\r\nhave been unable to definitively track the problem further. I have verified=\r\n that \nthe problem is not with CVode, but with the ReactorNet::eval() metho=\r\nd.\n\nAt first, I thought this might be the result of the modifications I hav=\r\ne made to Cantera, so I \ntried to verify the problem with the kinetics_exam=\r\nple1.cpp file from the most recent \nversion of Cantera (without my modifica=\r\ntions). This example file results in the same error.\n\nThe new version of Ca=\r\nntera takes 5 minutes, 21 seconds to execute the \nkinetics_example1.cpp whi=\r\nle the old version only takes 2.33 seconds. Also, the new \nversion never co=\r\nrrectly works since it exits prematurely.\n\nI was wondering if anyone was aw=\r\nare of this problem or knew what might be the problem? \nAny input or sugges=\r\ntions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael Lee\nSoftware Engineer=\r\n\nCFD Research Corporation\n\n\n"}}
