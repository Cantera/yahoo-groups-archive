I think it is a good fit to my\nproblem, but I&#39;d like the opinion of other more experienced\nusers before I dive fully in.\n\nI&#39;m thinking of using cantera as &quot;chemistry engine&quot; for a\nCFD code I&#39;m developing. I&#39;m mostly interested, at this time, on\nphase equilibrium, but I&#39;m *very* interested on adding chemical\nreactions later on.\n\nI intend to write mostly in python, with numpy (numarray\nto stay compatible with cantera) using finite differences.\nThe domains (and the number of cells) can be really big.\n\nWould you think cantera is appropriate for this?\nIf this does not sound too absurd, I have another question.\n\nI haven&#39;t really looked at cantera&#39;s code yet, but I&#39;m already\nthinking how to adapt it to a CFD code.\n\nThe fist and obvious way is to work with arrays of Cantera\nphases, ie, to store in each (of the many many thousands) cell\na cantera phase, and use it&#39;s own internal variables on each cell\nto keep track of molar fractions, etc. This would be _very_ neat,\nbut I&#39;m afraid there could be too much overhead, since a lot of\nthe information would be replicated on all cells.\n\nThe other would be to store everything myself, and just invoke\ncantera passing the full thermodynamical state to it. This looks kind\nof gross, considering I&#39;d be wasting a lot of the good thinking and\nhard work Dr. Goodwin already applied to this problem! In the end I&#39;d\nend up replicating most of the phases and fluid classes (which I\nalready had started to do, before I decided to check the internet,\njust in case someone had had the same problem before, and here I am).\n\nSorry for the long post, any comments or suggestions most welcome.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRamiro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
