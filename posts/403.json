One way to convert Surface Chemkin files is to \nedit them to make them look like gas-phase mechanisms, convert them to \n.cti format, then edit the .cti file to turn them back into surface \nmechanisms.  It&#39;s a bit cumbersome, but can actually be done in just a \nfew minutes.  This is how I created the input file for catalytic \ncombustion on platinum, for example.\n\nOf course, it wouldn&#39;t be so hard to write an &quot;sk2cti&quot; program, since \nit would just be a modification of the existing code to convert \ngas-phase mechanism files.  If anyone is interested, the relevant files \nare in Cantera/src/converters.  Take a look at CKParser.cpp and \nCKReader.cpp.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn May 27, 2004, at 11:10 AM, rppawlo wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt; I notice cantera has program to convert chemkin files to cantera\n&gt; format.
