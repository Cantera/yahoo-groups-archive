At \nthis=\r\n equivalence ratio the Cantera code should work seamlessly. At \nleast I cou=\r\nld calculate free burning velocities of the CH4/Air flames \nusing only C++ =\r\nroutines from Cantera for Phi &lt;=3D 1.6. Unfortunately, I \ndon&#39;t understand =\r\nPython scripts. There are a few remarks, though. \n1.\tIn calculations for in=\r\nitial guess a coarse grid should be \nused, 6 grid points is more than enoug=\r\nh.\n2.\tTolerances and other parameters for the TwoPnt solver are \ndifferent =\r\nthan those of mine. I used the following values:\nRTolSS =3D 1e-5           =\r\n                          ; Relative \ntolerance for steady state solution\nA=\r\nTolSS =3D 1e-010                                   ; Absolute \ntolerance fo=\r\nr steady state  solution\nRTolTS =3D 0.0001                                 =\r\n  ; Relative tolerance\n\tfor time step solution\nATolTS =3D 1e-005           =\r\n                        ; Relative \ntolerance for time step solution\nMaxTim=\r\neStep =3D 0.0001                              ; maximal time step \nNumberSt=\r\neps =3D &quot;1, 2, 5, 20, 50&quot;                   ; Number of steps \nfor time run=\r\ns\nTimeStep =3D 1e-006                                 ; initial time step\nT=\r\nimeStepfactor =3D 0.45                             ; multiplication \nfactor=\r\n after failure in time integration\nJacobianAge =3D 20                      =\r\n            ; maximal number of \niterations before evaluation of jacobian  =\r\n   \n\n3. Initial speed should be not very high and certainly less then the \n=\r\nfree burning velocity. I use usually 5 cm/s.  \n\nHope this helps. \nBest rega=\r\nrds,  Anatoli\n\n\n\n"}}
