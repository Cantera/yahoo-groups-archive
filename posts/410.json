I will try to get a binary Windows \ninstaller made tomorrow.\n\nNew features:\n\n- new ReactorNet class allows simulating multiple highly coupled \nreactors fully implicitly\n\n- accurate liquid/vapor equations of state for water, nitrogen, \nmethane, oxygen, hydrogen.  See Python and Matlab demos rankine.py and \nrankine.m, respectively, for an example of how to work with these.  Now \nit is possible to carry out vapor power cycle and combined cycle \nsimulations with Cantera.\n\n- most bugs identified by users have been fixed.\n\n- new Matlab and Python demo scripts.\n\n- new tutorials.\n\nEverything builds cleanly on linux, and all Python and Matlab demos run \nwithout problem. Same is true on Mac OS X.\n\nIf you encounter any problem building this, let me know so I can fix \nthe problem quickly.\n\nI am working on a document describing how to do reactor simulations \nwith Cantera 1.5.4.  It may be ready in a week or so.  In the meantime, \nlook at the demo scripts and programs. \n\n\n\n"}}
