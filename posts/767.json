You can tell\n&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; to use the new solver by givin=\r\ng a third non-zero parameter to\n&gt;&gt; equilibrate, e.g.:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; equilibrate(gas=\r\n, &#39;TP&#39;, 1)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If the third paramter is missing or zero, the old solver w=\r\nill be\n&gt; used,\n&gt;&gt; which is faster but less stable than the new one.  Equili=\r\nbrium\n&gt; problem\n&gt;&gt; usually arise from specifying very hard initial conditio=\r\nns, like an\n&gt;&gt; exactly stoichiometric fuel/air mixture at 300 K. Neverthele=\r\nss, the\n&gt; new\n&gt;&gt; solver should handle these cases.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Other than that, y=\r\nou will need to do some debugging to isolate the\n&gt;&gt; problem.  Since the tra=\r\nnsport demo works, you can start with it and\n&gt;&gt; modify it one line at a tim=\r\ne until it looks like your m-file that\n&gt;&gt; fails. In that way, you should be=\r\n able to track down exactly what\n&gt;&gt; change causes failure.  If it is not du=\r\ne to an initial condition\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; seems to be something in Cantera, then s=\r\nee how small an m-file you\n&gt; can\n&gt;&gt; create that still fails by removing ext=\r\nraneous lines.  For example,\n&gt;&gt; does it fail if you only do equillibrium? O=\r\nr do you need to compute\n&gt;&gt; transport propertiess for it to fail?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Onc=\r\ne you have isolated the problem, send the short m-file to me,\n&gt; and I\n&gt;&gt; ca=\r\nn see if it fails for me too, and see what the problem is.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; O=\r\nn Apr 13, 2005, at 7:27 AM, xiao-yen wang wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Prof. Goodwin:=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Two weeks ago I posted the following message:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, there: R=\r\necently I tried to run Cantera 1.5.5 with Matlab on\n&gt; PC.
