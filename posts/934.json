It made cantera fantastically easy to build from\n&gt; source.  It also included a compenent for building an installer.\n&gt; However, it doesn&#39;t look like version 1.6 has a solution file or a even\n&gt; win32 directory.  Are there any plans to include this helpful directory\n&gt; in the source code in cvs for current or future versions?\n&gt;     Thanks in advance,\n&gt;     Rebecca\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
