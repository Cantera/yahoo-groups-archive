What I meant (not sure\n&gt;=\r\n what a &quot;functor&quot; is) is to be able to set the mole fractions by using\n&gt; va=\r\nriables instead of the string in the set command. For example, I\n&gt; would li=\r\nke to do something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; mole_CH4 =3D 1.0\n&gt; mole_O2 =3D 1/phi*(1+y=\r\n/4.0)) # phi and y are computed in my code.\n&gt; mole_N2 =3D (1/phi*(1+y/4.0)*=\r\n(Xn2/Xo2)) # Xn2, Xo2 are mole fractions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then set the mole fractions w=\r\nith something like this:\n&gt; gas.set(T=3D900.0,P=3D1.0e5,X=3D&#39;CH4:mole_CH4,O2=\r\n:mole_O2,N2:mole_N2&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Right now, I just compute the new stoichiometry (=\r\naccording to my phi)\n&gt; and then modify the value in the set command. This i=\r\ns not a big deal,\n&gt; but it takes some time when you want to do the calculat=\r\nion for many\n&gt; conditions. Anatoli&#39;s approach is a very good idea. However,=\r\n it still\n&gt; requires the mole fractions to be given as strings, which do no=\r\nt\n&gt; support arithmetic operations. Thank you both again for your interest\n&gt;=\r\n and help.
