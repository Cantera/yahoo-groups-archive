Look at the cti file that ck2cti  \nproduces. Do the reaction specifications look right, and do all of  \nthe species have the correct elemental composition?  If that looks  \nOK, then check the CTML file for the entries for these 2 reactions  \nand their species.   Routine installReaction is in importCTML.cpp. If  \nall else fails, put diagnostic print statements in, and recompile  \nCantera. But really I don&#39;t think that is where the problem is - I  \nthink it is something in the input file.  It might be the fact that  \nyou are using periods in your species names - that should be OK, but  \nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever tried it.\n\nAlso, at the top of the cti file you can turn off mechanism  \nvalidation, which will result in the duplicate reaction test being  \nskipped.  I don&#39;t recommend this as a permanent fix, since there is a  \nproblem somewhere, but maybe it would let you get past this test and  \nshow you other errors that would pinpoint where the problem really  \nis.  By the way, on a large mechanism like this one, turning off  \nmechanism validation once you are sure the mechanism file is correct  \nmay significantly speed up the time required to read it in.\n\n\nAs far as the negative A coefficient error, the reaction number in  \nthe error message may be off by 1. Check the reaction before and  \nafter the number in the message.  Also, check the CTML file.  This  \nerror should only happen if an A value is really zero or negative. A  \nlarge postive A coefficient should be no problem.\n\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Apr 4, 2007, at 7:51 PM, kevinmwalters wrote:\n\n&gt; I get a duplicate reaction error for the following reactions:\n&gt;\n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt;                 Cantera Error!\n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt; Procedure: installReaction\n&gt; Error:   Undeclared duplicate reactions detected:\n&gt; Reaction 40: CH3OO. + CC(*O)OO. &lt;=&gt; CH3O. + O2 + CO2 + CH3\n&gt; Reaction 639: CH3 + O2 &lt;=&gt; CH3OO.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Should these just be listed as DUPLICATE, or is this a bug in ck2cti /\n&gt; cti interpreter?\n&gt; _____________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; I also get this error:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt;                 Cantera Error!\n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Procedure: getRateCoefficient\n&gt; Error:   negative or zero A coefficient for reaction 1983\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; #  Reaction 1983\n&gt; # 95HIP/NEU\n&gt; reaction(  &quot;H2O2 + OH &lt;=&gt; HO2 + H2O&quot;,  [2.67000E+41, -7, 37600],\n&gt;          options = [&quot;duplicate&quot;])\n&gt;\n&gt; Any idea what the cause of this may be?
