In MATLAB, there is no way that I can \nfind to delete the C++ Cantera object when the MATLAB &#39;shadow&#39; object \nis deleted (cleared).  So if you create lots of Cantera objects in the \nMATLAB workspace, it can consume memory that is not released even if \nyou type &#39;clear all&#39;.  I have provided a function &#39;cleanup&#39; that \ndeletes ALL Cantera objects.  If you use &#39;cleanup&#39;, you must also clear \nall Cantera objects from the MATLAB workspace, since they cannot be \nused once the underlying C++ objects are deleted.\n\nOr it could be a problem due to using MATLAB 6.5, since the Windows \nCantera MATLAB toolbox was compiled with MATLAB 7.\n\nIf MATLAB gives you problems, you could do your calculation in Python, \nwhich has better capabilities for memory management.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jun 28, 2005, at 9:19 AM, chrtom1979 wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Mr Goodwin,\n&gt;\n&gt; I finally manage to use the mixture equilibrate command (I work with\n&gt; Matlab6.5 in Windows environment) using Cantera1.6.
