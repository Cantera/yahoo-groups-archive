Today I also installed Cantera and Python\non my old computer running Win 2000.  Running the demos on this\nmachine also failed and indicated the same error.\n  \nAlso, I did copy the ctml_writer module to the &#39;site_pakages&#92;Cantera&#39;\nfolder and I can now run the &#39;check&#39; script from Python IDLE.  It\nappeared to execute successfully.  I am also able to run the &#39;cttmp&#39;\nfile from IDLE to generate a &#39;gri30.xml&#39; file.\n\nIncidentally, Josh Freeh on Mac Os X denotes a similar error. \nHowever, unlike Josh, the error is not resolved when Python is\nexecuted from DOS command prompt.\n\nThank you for your help,\n-Tom \n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tom -\n&gt; \n&gt; The &#39;check&#39; script is run whenever the &#39;cttmp&#39; script fails, to see\nif \n&gt; the problem is with the Cantera installation.  Unfortunately the \n&gt; single-line &#39;check&#39; script will always fail, since it tries to\nimport \n&gt; module &#39;ctml_writer&#39; from the Cantera package  (where it used to\nbe), \n&gt; instead of importing it directly.  The workaround is to copy file \n&gt; &#39;ctml_writer.py&#39; from the &#39;site_packages&#39; folder in the Python\nLibrary \n&gt; folder to the &#39;Cantera&#39; folder within &#39;site_packages&#39;.   it seems\nto me \n&gt; now that running the &#39;check&#39; script is more trouble than it is\nworth, \n&gt; and I am removing this step from the procedure followed to\ntranslate \n&gt; input files.\n&gt; \n&gt; But this does not answer why the cttmp script fails, since it works \n&gt; when you run it from the command line.  I&#39;m not sure why that is \n&gt; happening, but it must be some sort of path problem.  Perhaps try\nthe \n&gt; above fix and try again and see what happens...\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way - I assume you are using WinXP or Win2000.  Cantera will \n&gt; encounter problems under Win98 or WinME.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n"}}
