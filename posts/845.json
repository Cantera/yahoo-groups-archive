I read more detailed comments in\n&gt; Reactor.h file, and now I&#39;m wondering in the 1-dimensional flame\n&gt; examples (stflame1.py, npflame1.py) what is done to integrate chemical\n&gt; source terms for 1-d similarity equations.  Do you use the same\n&gt; large-volume strategy or is there any derived class from Reactor class\n&gt; that models constant-pressure process?  I tried to find a clue in\n&gt; StagnationFlow.py and onedim.py, but could tell what exactly is done\n&gt; in the code.
