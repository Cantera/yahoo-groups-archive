The reason it is slow is \nthat the algorithm uses a full, nomerically-computed Jacobian. This \nmeans that all reactors in a network are assumed to be strongly coupled \nto one another.  For many networks, this is not the case, and the \nJacobian is actually sparse.  Modifying the Jacobian evaluation \nprocedures in CVODE to take advantage of the structure of the Jacobian \nwould probably go a long way toward boosting speed.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jun 3, 2005, at 4:10 AM, usenechal wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt; is it possible to use the solver for spatial onedim-problems to solve\n&gt; continously stirred reactors with time as the dimension instead of\n&gt; space ?

I think the method you\n&gt; described (with an iteration over an plug flow reactor) could be\n&gt; improved in speed.\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; ulf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
