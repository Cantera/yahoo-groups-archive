I\nbelieve I =\r\nam having trouble with the connection between Cantera and\nMatlab as a resul=\r\nt of incorrect definition of environmental variables.\n\nThe following may be=\r\n relevant: I&#39;ve compiled and executed python 2.5.1\nusing Terminal Version 1=\r\n.5  (Mac program found in Utilities; as\nopposed to xcode). Additionally I&#39;v=\r\ne downloaded the CVS version of\ncantera using instructions from\nhttp://blue=\r\n.caltech.edu/~dgg/html/cantera-build.html and executed the\npreconfig file w=\r\nith minimum modifications. I&#39;ve executed mex -setup\nwithin the Matlab comma=\r\nnd window and changed Matlab&#39;s compiler to a\ngcc version.\n\nAfter running pr=\r\neconfig, a portion of the following code is produced:\n(Config SUMMARY OF IN=\r\nCLUDED/EXCLUDED CAPABILIIES:)\n...\nchecking for python2... no\nchecking for p=\r\nython...\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python\nP=\r\nython command set by configure to \n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Ver=\r\nsions/Current/bin/python\nMatlab command preset to /Applications/Matlab/bin/=\r\n\nchecking MATLAB (/Applications/Matlab/bin/)... failed!\nchecking for Positi=\r\non independent code command ...  -fPIC\nchecking for a BSD-compatible instal=\r\nl... /usr/bin/install -c\nINSTALL program has been set to  /usr/bin/install =\r\n-c\nchecking whether we are using the GNU C++ compiler... (cached) yes\ncheck=\r\ning whether g++ accepts -g... (cached) yes\n...\n\nI believe that when I am at=\r\ntempting to build the matlab toolbox I have\nincorrectly defined the variabl=\r\ne &quot;Matlab_CMD&quot;; as a result it fails to\nlocate Matlab on my computer. I am =\r\nnot sure what the value of\nMatlab_CMD should be (see code from preconfig fi=\r\nle below). Could\nsomeone explain what environmental variables are within th=\r\ne context of\nCantera? Also, any are there any obvious things I am doing inc=\r\norrectly?\n\nEli Goldstein \n\n#----------- MATLAB ----------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n\n# This variable controls whether the MATLAB toolbox=\r\n will be built. It\n# should be set to one of these strings:\n#\n#      &quot;defau=\r\nlt&quot;     the &#39;configure&#39; script will try to build a simple \n#               =\r\n     MATLAB MEX file. If this succeeds,\nBUILD_MATLAB_TOOLBOX\n#             =\r\n       will be set to &quot;y&quot;, otherwise it will be set to &quot;n&quot;.\n#              =\r\n      \n#      &quot;y&quot;           build the MATLAB toolbox.\n#      &quot;n&quot;           =\r\ndo not build the MATLAB toolbox, even if MATLAB is \n#                    in=\r\nstalled.\n#\n# Note that you may need to run &#39;mex -setup&#39; within MATLAB to\n# =\r\nconfigure it for your C++ compiler before running this script.\nBUILD_MATLAB=\r\n_TOOLBOX=3D${BUILD_MATLAB_TOOLBOX:=3D&quot;y&quot;}\nMATLAB_CMD=3D${MATLAB_CMD:=3D&quot;/Ap=\r\nplications/Matlab/bin/&quot;}\n\n\n\n"}}
