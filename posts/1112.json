Can you send the cti file?  There may be\nsomething in how the reaction is written that&#39;s making cantera think\nit doesn&#39;t pertain to the phase you&#39;ve created.\n\nAlso, I&#39;m wondering in what way does the code &#39;not recognize the\nreaction&#39;?  If you create the phase and then run the equations\n&#39;rxnEqs(phase name)&#39;, does it return the reaction string?  Does\n&#39;nReactions(phase name)&#39; give the correct number of reactions? \nAnyway, if you attach the cti file, perhaps one of us here can see if\nanything in there is causing the problem.\n\nBest,\nSteven\n\n\n\n--- jocie_squirl &lt;jocie_squirl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone was using a global one step reaction in\n&gt; Matlab.  I am trying to \n&gt; get the reaction CH4 + 2 O2 =&gt; CO2 + 2H2O to work with some of the\n&gt; demos (diffflame).  \n&gt; I was able to create a cti file but it seems the flame code doesn&#39;t\n&gt; recognize the reaction.  If \n&gt; anyone has successfully used a one step, global reaction with any\n&gt; of the flame code?\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jocelyn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
