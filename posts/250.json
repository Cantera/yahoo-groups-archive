My work involves modeling of energy systems,\n&gt; advising graduate students and assessment of energy analysis\n&gt; software.  I do some work with Brooks Moses, Matt Svrcek and Patrick\n&gt; Caton (all members of the users group).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been working on writing an interface for cantera/MATLAB that\n&gt; will use &quot;lightweight&quot; objects (see Brooks&#39;s post of 8/18/2003) and\n&gt; that will be accessible to graduate students (1st year master&#39;s\n&gt; level) in a class on thermodynamic modeling.  I&#39;ve noticed that\n&gt; Cantera has a limited number of ways to set state variables.  For\n&gt; example, one can set Temperature and Pressure simultaneously, but\n&gt; not Temperature and Entropy.  While it was relatively easy to write\n&gt; my own functions to perform the appropriate calculations, it is a\n&gt; bit confusing that Cantera accepts the command to set said variables:\n&gt;\n&gt; gas = gri30\n&gt; s0 = entropy_mass(gas)\n&gt; T0 = temperature(gas)\n&gt; s1 = s0\n&gt; T1 = T0 + 100\n&gt; set(gas,&#39;T&#39;,T1,&#39;S&#39;,s1)\n&gt;\n&gt; but returns no warning that temperature was set, entropy input was\n&gt; ignored, and density was held fixed.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see that this &quot;quirk&quot; is referenced to some extent in the C++\n&gt; users guide, but it is my opinion that the interface should also\n&gt; return a message when it is unable to appropriately respond to the\n&gt; user&#39;s input.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me know if there is any way that I can help.\n&gt;\n&gt; -A.J.
