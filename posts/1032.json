I did try several ways to do it and I had not\nsuccess. I attached in my previous e-mail two\nmechanism   files, both with &#39;C7H16 + 11O2&#39; reactants.\nThe ck2cti replays the following error message:\n\nSyntax error: undeclared reactant species 1O2  (line\n8)\n\nWhen I change to, for example, &#39;C7H16 + 9O2 + 2O2&#39; no\nerror apears.\nI looked for the code parts where the parse is donne\nand I found that in the lines 112 and 113 of\nCKParser.cpp:\n\n112:  else if (ch != &#39;.&#39; && (ch &lt; &#39;0&#39; || ch &gt; &#39;9&#39;)) {\n113:     return UNDEF;\n114:  }\n\nIt seems that the parser have a limitation about the\nnumber of a given specie in the reaction, which must\nto be 0&lt;=N&lt;=9! Am I right?\n\nI did see that the converted file that you sent us\nhave &#39;11 O2&#39; in the reactions. How you did it?\n\nPlease, can you or somebody help me? \n\nMany tanks in advance for your help and for any that\ncan help me.\n\nWladimyr\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nFa�a liga��es para outros computadores com o novo Yahoo!
