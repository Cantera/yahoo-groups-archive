I am using the setState_HP method to fix the enthalpy, and\nperform the calculation at successively lower enthalpies.\n\nOne thing that could be very useful is to implement the &quot;contin&quot;\noption that would allow a better initial guess for the equilibrium\nstate to be provided.  Are there plans to do this in the near future?\n\nThanks,\n\nJames\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I haven&#39;t run into this problem before. I suppose you&#39;re decreasing\nthe \n&gt; enthalpy by calling &#39;setState_HP&#39; first with the desired enthalpy\nand \n&gt; pressure and initial composition.  I bet the problem is that the \n&gt; resulting initial temperature is so low that it is either out of\nrange \n&gt; for the thermo data, or causes numerical problems for other reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you run the problem fixing (T,P) rather than (H,P)?\n&gt; \n&gt; You might also try the new equilibrium solver, which doesn&#39;t use \n&gt; ChemEquil.  In Python, you can access it by creating a &#39;Mixture&#39; \n&gt; containing the gas phase:\n&gt; \n&gt; gas = GRI30()\n&gt; mix = Mixture([(gas, 1.0)])\n&gt; mix.equilibrate(&#39;HP&#39;)\n&gt; print mix\n&gt; \n&gt; And if you want to include a condensed phase, you can do it like\nthis:\n&gt; gas = GRI30()\n&gt; carbon = importPhase(&#39;graphite.cti&#39;)\n&gt; mix = Mixture([(gas, 1.0), (carbon, 0.0)])\n&gt; mix.equilibrate(&#39;HP&#39;)\n&gt; print mix\n&gt; \n&gt; Depending on the version of Cantera you have this may or may not\nwork.  \n&gt; It definitely works with the prerelease of version 1.6, available\nby \n&gt; CVS.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 29, 2005, at 11:05 AM, jcs6a50 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone had trouble getting ChemEquil to behave?
