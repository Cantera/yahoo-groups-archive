The python code does indeed work, but I converted that \nexample exactally to C++ and as soon as you advance the solution is \nwhen the core dump occurs.  I assume that this must be some sort of \nbug in the c++ interface?  From reading postings this group it would \nseem that most people use either the python or matlab interface.  \nWould you suggest using this route?  I personally perfer to code in \nc/c++ which is why I was trying it this way.\n\nregards,\ndarin\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Darin,\n&gt; \n&gt; Try running python example &#39;mix1.py&#39;.
