Replace &quot;stoichiometric_solid&quot; with  \n&gt; &quot;pure_solid&quot; and it should work.  I had meant to change &quot;pure&quot; to  \n&gt; &quot;stoichiometric&quot; and wrote the documentation that way, but forgot to  \n&gt; make the change in the code itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; A cti file can use any variable defined by the Cantera Python (not  \n&gt; Matlab) interface.  The name &quot;OneAtm&quot; is defined in both. When  \n&gt; processing a cti file, Cantera cannot access Matlab variables.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 30, 2004, at 8:40 AM, y2kpac wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dave,\n&gt; &gt; When importing a certain surface mechanism .cti file that I wrote,\n&gt; &gt; the following error was returned to me.

Does this mean that where\n&gt; &gt; numerics are required in the .cti file, the names of variables\n&gt; &gt; previously defined/declared in the Matlab script can be used\n&gt; &gt; instead?  Should these variables be global?  How should they be\n&gt; &gt; defined or declared?  For example, is the following .cti file\n&gt; &gt; section valid?
