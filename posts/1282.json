In order to run \ncantera using c++, a=\r\nnd not python or matlab, is it possible to write \nroutines that use these l=\r\nibraries directly, and not have to install \ncantera using a .msi file? Basi=\r\ncally working without the additional \noverhead.\n\n2) Is it necessary to have=\r\n visual fortran to build cantera, if fortran \nfiles are not to be used. I h=\r\nave read that some parts of Cantera use \nfortran based code, requiring a fo=\r\nrtran compiler during build.\nI just want to know if Cantera can be complete=\r\nly built using visual \nstudio alone.\n\nI intend to post instructions on how =\r\nto setup and use Cantera from c++ \nalone using this free Express version. T=\r\nhis would be of interest to \nmany that only want to use c++ with cantera.\n\n=\r\nThanks in advance to any repliers,\nCheers,\nAdam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
