Tutorials and examples \nare provided that illustrate how to use it.\n\nThe toolbox includes a reactor function with user-specified dV/dt and \nheat flux that allows virtually any zero-dimensional kinetics \nsimulation to be carried out. With a few minor modifications reactor \nnetworks could be simulated. The reactor function is written in \nMatlab&#39;s scripting language, so it can be quickly modified and run \nwith no need to compile or link anything. MATLAB&#39;s own stiff ODE \nintegrators can be used for integration. (See examples/ignite.m for \nan example of its use.)\n\nBenchmark kinetics simulations in MATLAB with GRI-Mech 3.0 take a few \nseconds  on a typical PC. This is much slower than the same \nsimulation done in C++ with Cantera (~ 0.5 s), but still very \nreasonable, and the ease of customizing the calculation more than \ncompensates for the slower performance. (If speed really matters, \nMATLAB includes the ability to compile &#39;.m&#39; functions to C code.)\n\nThis diversion has delayed my promised update to the Cantera Python \ninterface... this is next up.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
