All I\n&gt; got to do was put the Cantera toolbox folder at the beginning of the\n&gt; Matlab path. I always put directories of my code (or third parties&#39;\n&gt; ones) at the end of the path, so I can prevent exactly the\n&gt; overloading of built-in functions or functions from Mathworks\n&gt; toolboxes.\n&gt; So, the problem may be solved this way. But I believe it would be\n&gt; better off if third parties&#39; toolboxes needed not to overload a built-\n&gt; in function, just in case a user needs both of them in his/her code.\n&gt; Of course in this case it is not likely.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your time,\n&gt;\n&gt; Marcus Vinicius\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Marcus,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I haven&#39;t run into this problem before, and have been using that\n&gt;&gt; version of Matlab.

Just downloaded it and tried the\n&gt; demos,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; when I found an execution error. It seems that Matlab R13 (6.5)\n&gt; has a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; built-in &#39;surface&#39; function and so there is a name conflict with\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Cantare toolbox.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I wanted to (1) report it, because I don&#39;t know if someone else\n&gt; did\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it, and (2) know if there is a newer version of the toolbox with\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name of this particular function changed (and all the references\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it in other files).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I could just change the names myself and send back the toolbox\n&gt; code\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with the changes, but I guess the maintainer(s) of the code would\n&gt;&gt;&gt; like to choose the new name of the function.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you the great job done in Cantera.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Marcus Vinicius\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
