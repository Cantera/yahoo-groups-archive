The property values \ncomputed agree well with those from TRANLIB (but see below), and it \nruns on the systems I&#39;ve tested about twice as fast as TRANLIB. The \nbiggest reason for the performance increase is that the L matrix \nequation is solved iteratively using GMRES, rather than by LU \ndecomposition (although it can do it with LU decomposition too).\n\nIn the course of developing this package, I have discovered what may \nbe a minor inconsistency in the TRANFIT program used by the TRANLIB \npackage. Essentially, TRANFIT applies a certain second-order \ncorrection to the binary diffusion coefficients that the TRANLIB \ndocumentation says is not being applied, and theory indicates \nprobably shouldn&#39;t be applied when using these coefficients to \nevaluate multicomponent properties. This correction affects some \nbinary diffusion coefficients by as much as 7% for the test cases I \nran, and affects the multicomponent diffusion coefficients by perhaps \n3% or 4%. This is probably not a problem for most simulations. The \nCantera multicomponent trannsport package does not apply this \ncorrection. If any of you are users of TRANFIT/TRANLIB and would like \nto know more about this issue, send me an e-mail message.\n\nIf this correction is disabled in TRANFIT (which can be done in the \nold Chemkin-II version if you have the source, but can&#39;t be in the \nChemkin-III version), then the properties computed agree to about \n0.2%. The remaining discrepancy is apparently due to slightly \ndifferent ways of generating the polynomial fits to collision \nintegrals (which are only +/- 1% accurate anyway).\n\nThis transport package should be available in a few days. \n\nI have also been cleaning up and slightly reorganizing some low-level \nC++ code. If you are using Cantera in C++, let me know and I will try \nto minimize disruption.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
