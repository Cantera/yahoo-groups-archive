Is it Kc or Kp?\n\n2) Again in the reactions frame, the=\r\n Rev ROP column contains strange\nand often negative values for me. The valu=\r\nes in the Fwd ROP column\nlook fine to me. Does the Rev ROP column contain t=\r\nhe reverse rate\nconstant times the concentrations of the products, i.e. qre=\r\nv =3D\nkrev*[P1][P2]...[Pn]? Is there a bookkeeping reason why these would b=\r\ne\nnegative?\n\n3) When I click the &quot;Concentration&quot; radio button in the Compos=\r\nition\nframe, I get the following warning:\n\nException in Tkinter callback\nTr=\r\naceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;lib&#92;lib-tk&#92;Tkinter.py&quot;=\r\n, line 1345, in __call__\n    return self.func(*args)\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;li=\r\nb&#92;site-packages&#92;MixMaster&#92;CompositionFrame.py&quot;,\nline 91, in show\n    mf.com=\r\np =3D mix.concentrations()\nAttributeError: Mix instance has no attribute &#39;c=\r\noncentrations&#39;\n\nI added a little method called concentrations() to the Mix =\r\nclass that\nseems to fix this, but this is probably dangerous because I real=\r\nly\ndon&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.\n\n    def concentrations(self):\n        return=\r\n self._moles/self.totalMoles()*self.g.molarDensity()\n\n\nThanks very much.
