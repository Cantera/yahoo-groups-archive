I=\r\n am currently working with npflame1.py.  I have successfully\nrun the latest=\r\n version from the CVS repository (C2H6/air) with no\nissues.  \n\nWhen I attem=\r\npt to change the fuel or oxidizer content, I am having a\nfew issues:  \n\nFir=\r\nst, I have to work with grid refinement to get a reasonable result\n(with su=\r\nfficient data points) with any change.  This is not really an\nissue, just l=\r\nooking for any input on method/approach with the grid\nparameters.  \n\nSecond=\r\n, I am getting erroneous result for the temperature profile in\nthat it stay=\r\ns at a constant 300K across the solution space.  In the\noriginal version, t=\r\nhe solution gives an appropriate result with\ntemperature increasing towards=\r\n the center of the solution space, where\nthe flame exists.  \n\nI have tried =\r\nrunning with CH4, and tried with a diluted fuel mixture\n(C2H6 and N2, etc).=\r\n  Both result in the erroneous temperature profile.\n\nI would appreciate any=\r\n assistance.\n\n\nThanks, Michael\n\n\n"}}
