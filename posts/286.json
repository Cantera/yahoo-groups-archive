The capability \nto use these files is built-in to the operating system. If the \noperating system doesn&#39;t recognize it, you are probably using an older \nversion of Windows,  If so, you can download the Windows Installer from \nthe Microsoft website, which may fix the problem.  However, I compile \nthe Cantera Windows binary version on a Win 2000 machine, and don&#39;t \nknow if it runs on older OS versions.\n\nAs far as building from the source, make sure you have the source \ndistributioo (not the binary distribution), and have a file called \n&#39;configure&#39; in the Cantera top-level directory.  You may need to type \n&#39;./configure&#39; at the bash prompt instead of &#39;configure&#39;, depending on \nhow your PATH environment variable is set.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nDave Goodwin\n\n\n\n"}}
