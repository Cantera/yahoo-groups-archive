I created the Visual Studio 2005 projects fro=\r\nm scratch by translating the \nMakefiles, so the base, kinetics, thermo, etc=\r\n are in separate libraries instead of in \ncantera.lib.\n\nI would imagine tha=\r\nt this will also work for Microsoft&#39;s newly released Visual Studio 2008 \nve=\r\nrsion, but I have not verified it.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael Lee\nSoftware Engineer=\r\n\nCFD Research Corporation\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Michael Lee&quot; &lt;=\r\nmelee.list@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to build cantera&#39;s c+=\r\n+ library with Visual Studio 2005 (importing the vc7 \n&gt; solution).
