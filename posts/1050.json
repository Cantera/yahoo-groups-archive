But I think Cantera \nlib=\r\nrary in Matlab does not have Gaussian Impulse for initial ignition \nof the =\r\nmixture. Since I am not familiar with Python and it does not \nhave the plot=\r\n capabilities of the Matlab at the first place, I tried \nto build a Gaussia=\r\nn pulse object in Matlab. Unfortunately I have not \nbeen able to do this so=\r\n far. So I was wondering if anyone is dealing \nwith similar problem and has=\r\n a solution to it.\nProfessor Goodwin:\nwould you tell me what is the formula=\r\n that you used for Gaussian \nimpulse in Python?\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
