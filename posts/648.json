I was checking equilibrium conditions \nfor certain reactions. I have a problem. I carried out a reaction by \nspecifying a temperature and pressure. I used equilibrate function \nat constant temperature and volume. After this I checked the \npressure again. It was equal to the initial pressure specified. The \ntotal number of moles are changing in the reaction, and I had \ncarried out the equilibrium at constant temperature and volume. Then \nwhy is the pressure same as initially specified? \nAjay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
