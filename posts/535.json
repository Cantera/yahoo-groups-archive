It \ndescribes how to use Cantera to evaluate properties of several pure \nfluids with full liquid/vapor equations of state, including liquid, \nvapor, supercritical, and saturation states. (Five such fluids, \nincluding water, are implemented so far in Cantera.) You can do \neverything with Cantera that you could do with steam tables or similar \nproperty evaluation software, but you can do it in MATLAB or Python, \nwhich allows you to build complete simulations of vapor power cycles \nand similar processes.\n\nThe emphasis is on how to do this from MATLAB, although Python is \ndiscussed too.  An example of a Rankine cycle is presented.  The file \nname is &quot;liquidvapor.pdf&quot; in the Cantera Documentation package.\n\nFor fellow Mac users:\nI have posted a binary installer for Cantera for Mac OS 10.3. It \ncontains the Cantera Python package and MATLAB Toolbox for MATLAB 7 \n(Release 14), plus the usual assortment of demos, etc.  It also \ncontains MixMaster packaged as a Mac application, so you should be able \nto run it by just double-clicking its icon in the Finder (look in \n/Applications/Cantera), assuming you have tkinter installed. See \nappendix B of the above document for more on installation procedures.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n"}}
