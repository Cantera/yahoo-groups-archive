Those two mechanisms have anyway good \na=\r\ngreement on flame temperature and species gradients.\n\nHere is the modificat=\r\nion I made to incorporate the San diego \nmechanism in the .py file:\n\ngas =\r\n=3D IdealGasMix(&#39;san_diego.cti&#39;)\n#gas =3D GRI30(&#39;Mix&#39;)\ngas.addTransportMode=\r\nl(&#39;Mix&#39;)\n\nMoreover, those results seem to me under-estimating the CH4/air \n=\r\nlaminar flame speed. I would have expected values closer to 40cm/s.\n\nThank =\r\nyou very much for your help and comments.\n\nBruno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
