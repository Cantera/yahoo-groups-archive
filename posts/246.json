I can&#39;t find any directories named ext/tpx in the CANTERA source \ndistribution (&#92;src).  Only &#92;src&#92;converters, &#92;src&#92;oneD, \n&#92;src&#92;transport and &#92;src&#92;zeroD.\n\nThe only file I can find that containg ext or tpx is EOS_TPX.h.\n\nI can find no files with ext in the name.\n\n2.  Does this mean that the current C++ code of CANTERA supports \ncalculations of 2-phase equilibrium properties (i.e. liquid/gas and \nsolid/gas such as water/air and ice/air)?  \n\n3.  I ask #2 in because Message 167 (from Alessandro Veneroni) you \nsay:\n\n&quot;Multiphase equilibrium is not currently implemented.

See, for example, the files in directory ext/tpx \nin  \n&gt; the source distribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as when they will make it into the Matlab version, that is \na  \n&gt; hard question.  I have recently taken on some additional \nadministrative  \n&gt; responsibilities here at Caltech  \n&gt; (http://www.its.caltech.edu/~offoffac), with the result that the \ntime I  \n&gt; can devote to further development of Cantera is now fairly \nlimited. But  \n&gt; since Cantera is open source, anyone can add features, although it \ndoes  \n&gt; require digging through some source code to figure out the \ninternal  \n&gt; workings.  One of the goals I have for the medium term is to \nbetter  \n&gt; document the internal C++ structure, so that others can more \neasily  \n&gt; contribute to the development.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 20, 2003, at 1:02 PM, kdpatch wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dave--\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2 questions:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.  Will the next release of CANTERA allow MATLAB to access \nliquid\n&gt; &gt; properties (i.e. H2O liquid)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2.  Do you have any timing in mind for when CANTERA will \ncalculate 2-\n&gt; &gt; phase equilibrium properties (i.e. liquid/gas)?
