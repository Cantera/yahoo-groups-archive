You can find the mechanism discussed in Failor et al., J. \nPhys. Chem. 96 (9): 3742-3752 (1992), and references 10 and 11 of \nthat paper discuss the details of the mechanism itself.  The concept \nis that the energetic electrons from beta decay of tritium have \nenough energy to facilitate hydrogen oxidation, even in the absence \nof an elevated temperature to provide thermal energy.\n\nCharlie Westbrook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;I&#39;m interested in whether anyone is using Cantera to simulate reactions\n&gt;of ionized species such as would occur in a weakly ionized gas. It\n&gt;seems to me that one could augment the normal kinetics that come out\n&gt;of a GRI reaction mechanism with a Saha equation calculation of the\n&gt;ionization process. However, this would require that electrons be\n&gt;treated as actual species in the reaction mechanism, and I don&#39;t know\n&gt;whether there are serious problems in doing this. Can anyone comment\n&gt;on the suitability of this type of a model?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt;Rick Muller\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
