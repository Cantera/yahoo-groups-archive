When my\nnetwork \nconsists of 20 reactors, the CPU time is 2.62 sec; when there are 40\nreactors, \nthe CPU time is 21.9 sec.... 60 reactors -&gt; 65.56 sec.  \n \nI intend to use Cantera for the modelling of reactive flows.  A CFD\nsoftware will \ncall upon Cantera numerous times during a simulation... I also expect\nto use \nmany reactors, so the escalating CPU time is a problem. \n \nI am working in C, and have been using the following to build and\nadvance the \nnetwork: \n---------------------------------------- \nReactor r[numReact]; ... \nReactorNet sim; \n\tfor (i = 0; i &lt; numReact; i++){ \n\tsim.addReactor(&r[i]); \n\t}  ... \nsim.advance(tau); \n----------------------------------------- \n \nIf the reactors are independent why does the time escalate so?\nShouldn&#39;t it be \nlinear?  Is there a better way?  \n \nThanks, \nGerard \n \nnote- \nIn my tests, the reactors are not connected to each other.  The\npurpose of the \n&quot;network&quot; is so I can use sim.advance(tau) and have all of the\nreactors evolve at \nonce.   \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
