I just installed cantera 1.5.5 too, and I also ran into\n&gt; problems with ctbin.m not being included in the install.\n&gt; \n&gt; Did you make your own ctbin.m? Or did you edit ck2cti.m? In either\n&gt; case I would be very interested in knowing exactly how you solved \nthis\n&gt; problem if you did already.
