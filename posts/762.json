I\nneed compute the transport properties of a gas mixture. I run the file\ntransport1.m in the MATLAB/demos and it works fine. But when I run my\nown M file in which function equilibrate is used, I got different kind\nof error messages. Sometimes, it runs and gives me a reasonable result,\nsometimes, it runs and gives Nan for all transport properties, sometimes\nit does not run and gives error message such as &#39;segmentation error&#39;.\nNote that the code itself is the same. I just try run different times.\nIt gives me different things. I guess it is related to memory. Any help\nto fix this will be highly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n\nI have not received any reply. My colleague had the similar problem. We are in the process to incoporate Cantera into our system modleing using Matlab. One of my colleague does NOT has problem because he has the older version of Cantera. We need a solution to fix the problem. Could you please look into this? Should we download the older version of Cantera? And which version should we use?\n\nThanks again!\n\nxiaoyen wang\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
