I hav=\r\ne\nprofiles of T(time) and P(time) from a separate fluid-dynamic\ncalculation=\r\n of flow in a probe and sample line. I&#39;m assuming plug flow\nand so using th=\r\ne zero-d eqns with time in the batch system really\nrepresenting residence t=\r\nime along the PFR (i.e. sample line). (I&#39;m\ntrying to predict measurement er=\r\nrors due to chemical conversion in\nsample systems used to measure trace gas=\r\nes from jet aircraft engines.)\nI have a table of values for time, T and P t=\r\nhat I would like to\ninterpolate to get the current reactor conditions.\n\nDoe=\r\ns anyone have a Python script to model a variable-T,P reactor or\nsome gener=\r\nal guidance about how to approach the problem? Thanks very\nmuch for your he=\r\nlp.\n\nI&#39;m using the Python interface to Cantera v1.6.\n\nBest,\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
