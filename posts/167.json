But you can do it  \nyourself. For example, suppose you want to allow solid silicon, You  \nneed to know some thermodynamic data for solid silicon, so that you can  \ncompute its Gibbs function. This is available from many sources,  \nincluding the NIST Chemistry WebBook.\n\nNow create a Si-C-H gas mixture with the species you want to consider.  \nPick an overall Si/C/H elemental ratio, and pick some fraction of the  \nsilicon to be  in the solid phase. Initialize the gas composition so  \nthat it contains the rest of the silicon, plus all of the carbon and  \nhydrogen. It doesn&#39;t matter which species you choose for the initial  \ncomposition; only the elemental composition matters. Set the gas to  \nequilibrium holding (T,P) fixed.\n\nNow compute the total Gibbs function at the desired (T,P):   G(T,P)  =  \n(solid_Si_mass) x g(Si)  +  (gas_mass) x g(gas).  Adjust the mass of  \nthe solid Si, recomputing the gas composition each time and setting it  \nto equilibrium, until G reaches a minimum.\n\nYou can do the same process considering SiC or C as the condensed phase,\n\nYou can also quickly map out the regions of the ternary phase diagram  \nwhere solid phases will first precipitate out. For this purpose, it is  \nconvenient to include atomic Si and atomic C in the vapor. Compute the  \ngas-only equilibrium composition, and examine the chemical potentials  \nof Si and C in the vapor. Solid Si will appear where the vapor Si  \nchemical potential = the Gibbs function for the solid. Same idea for C.  \nFor SiC, the solid will precipitate where the silicon carbide Gibbs  \nfunction = the sum of the Si and C vapor chemical potentials. The  \nregion where the vapor species chemical potentials are lower than all  \npossible solids is the region where no precipitates exist.\n\nDave G.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, July 22, 2003, at 03:18 AM, Alessandro wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Professor Goodwin,\n&gt; I am a PhD student and I would like to study the multiphase\n&gt; thermodynamic\n&gt; equilibrium of a Si-H-C system.\n&gt; I have already studied the gas phase equlibrium of the same system\n&gt; with\n&gt; Cantera.\n&gt; I would like to know if it is possible study it with the Cantera code.\n&gt; Where can I find an example or the documentation about the multiphase\n&gt; equilibrium?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Alessandro Veneroni\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
