Suppose for example that 2 diatomics react very differently \nif they collide end-to-end rather than on the sides.  While the total \nreaction rate is determined by averaging over all initial orientations, \nit may be that the two pathways have very different activation \nenergies.  Expressing the rate as one reaction would require a \nnon-Arrhenius rate constant.  By writing it as 2 reactions, each one \ncan have its own Arrhenius rate constant.  Or sometimes duplicate \nreactions are used to implement non-Arrhenius rate constants, even if \nthe reason the rate constant does not fit the Arrhenius form is not \nknown. For example, if a reaction has a measured rate constant that is \nrepresented by\n\nk = A1 exp(-E1/RT) - A2 exp(-E2/RT)\n\nthen 2 reactions can be defined, one for each term.  The second one \nwill have a negative pre-exponential factor, but as long as it is \nalways used together with the reaction representing the first term, \nthere is no problem. The danger of course is that someday someone will \ncome along and edit the mechanism file removing the first reaction but \nnot the second.  A better solution would be (in principle at least) to \nimplement another reaction rate form besides Arrhenius so that \nreactions with non-Arrhenius rate constants can be defined directly, \nwithout resorting to these tricks.\n\n\nOn May 22, 2005, at 2:20 PM, aedahoe wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But why do people add the same reaction twice to the scheme?\n&gt; When the chemical equations are viewed upon as a system\n&gt; of algebraic equations, the repeated occurrence of the same\n&gt; reaction introduces redundancy.

Why is this? When I look\n&gt;&gt;&gt; at the kinetic scheme (H2-O2-N2-Ar) by Marinov, Westbrook & Pitz,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no duplicate reactions.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Arief\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arief,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (1) why are there no thermodynamic and reaction\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; data in it, as in the case of h2o2.xml?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the file I sent you, I prefaced the species entry\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with &quot;gri30: &quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and also the reactions entry.  This means that Cantera will look\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these species / reactions in file gri30.xml, instead of in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; local\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; file.  The gri30.xml file comes with Cantera.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (2) what is the role of the file h2o2.xml? Is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it an output file, or is it being used during the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flame calculations?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When Cantera reads a .cti input file, it first converts it to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; another\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; format and gives it the extension .xml.  The xml file is then\n&gt; read\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; build the objects used in the application program.  You can\n&gt; regard\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .xml file as an internal intermediate file that you don&#39;t have\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; worry\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about.  Alternatively, once you have created the xml file, you\n&gt; can\n&gt;&gt;&gt; use\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it in place of the cti file in your program.  This is useful if\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to run Cantera on a machine that does not have Python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; installed,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since Python is required to do the cti -&gt; xml conversion but not\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read the xml file.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (3) I modified the file h2o2.cti, such that it contains\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ideal_gas(name = &quot;ohmech&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       elements = &quot; O  H  Ar  N &quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       species = &quot;&quot;&quot; H2  H  O  O2  OH  H2O  HO2  H2O2  AR\n&gt; N2 &quot;&quot;&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       reactions = &quot;all&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       transport = &quot;Mix&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       initial_state = state(temperature = 300.0,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       pressure = OneAtm)    ).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, when I perform the flame calculation I get\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the error message species &quot;N2&quot; unknown. Why do I get\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this error mesage?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because it is looking for a definition of species &quot;N2&quot; in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; local\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; file, but not finding one.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PS. To replace AR by N2 I redefined AR in the .cti file,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such that it contains 2 nitrogen atoms and accompanying\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; physical data. This seems to work.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That works. Or you can just add a species entry for N2 in\n&gt; addition\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AR.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
