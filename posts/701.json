For example, for a \nreaction like\n\nCOOH +=\r\n M &lt;=3D&gt; CO + OH\n\nthe COOH -&gt; OH arrow and the COOH -&gt; CO arrow would both =\r\nhave a weight \nequal to the reaction forward rate of progress, since one O =\r\natom goes \nto each. The total weight is the sum over all reactions connecti=\r\nng the \ntwo species.\n\nThe situation is more complex when two reactants and =\r\ntwo products have \nthe element being traced, for example:\n\nOH + H2O2 &lt;=3D&gt; =\r\nHO2 + H2O\n\nWhich reactant does the O in H2O come from?\n\nThis reaction could=\r\n describe an H abstraction:\n      (O-H) + (H)(O2-H) =3D (O-H)(H) + (O2-H)\n\n=\r\nor it could describe an O abstraction:\n      (O-H) + (O)(O-H2) =3D (O-H)(O)=\r\n + (O-H2)\n\nIn the first case, H2O should be connected to OH in an O-atom re=\r\naction \npath diagram, and in the second case it should be connected to H2O2=\r\n.  \nCantera makes the choice by default so that the &quot;transferred species&quot; \n=\r\nis the lightest. In this case, it will choose the H abstraction \nalternativ=\r\ne, since H is lighter than O. It is possible in principle to \nspecify for e=\r\nach reaction the &quot;groups&quot; that rearrange in the reaction - \ni.e. which bond=\r\ns break - and override Cantera&#39;s default.  But actually \nthe CTI file speci=\r\nfication does not yet implement this. In any case, a \nfile rxnpath.log is w=\r\nritten every time a reaction path diagram is \ngenerated listing all ambiguo=\r\nus reactions and the one Cantera chooses.\n\nA long answer, but there it is..=\r\n. hope it helps.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jan 31, 2005, at 2:08 AM, schoen79 wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; I=B4m a new user of Cantera and MixMaster.
