If you&#39;re\nleaving the Tin at 300 K in the &#39;difflame.m&#39; code, this means that\nthe exponential term in the reaction rate:\n\n exp(-Eact/RT)\n\nis equal to ~ 6.94e-30, which would definitely explain the reaction&#39;s\nlack of impact on the overal state of the gas.  As is, this reaction\nwould only show appreciable progress at considerably higher T. \nEither changing the units line or decreasing the activation energy\nwould make this reaction proceed faster at a lower T.\n\nHope this helps,\nSteven\n\n\n\n--- Jocelyn Squirrel &lt;jocie_squirl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks for all the advice.  Attached is the cti file that I have\n&gt; been using \n&gt; with diffflame.m.  The program will run but returns only the cold\n&gt; solution.  \n&gt; Changing the pre-exponential factor does not seem to affect this\n&gt; (tried from \n&gt; 10 to 10^30 with no luck).  Also tried placing it into a detailed\n&gt; model and \n&gt; increasing the preexponential factor, but it didn&#39;t change the\n&gt; flame \n&gt; solution.  Could someone please try this and/or send me a cti file\n&gt; that \n&gt; works with a flame?
