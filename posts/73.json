The procedure is admittedly not\nobvious, since there is no manual yet describing these capabilities. I\nhave put an example CSTR C++ program in the &quot;Files&quot; section of this\nsite, in folder &quot;C++ examples&quot;. \n\nCantera takes a somewhat different approach than most other similar\npackages. A CSTR is constructed from predefined components - a reactor\nbody, an upstream reservoir supplying the reactants, a mass flow\ncontroller, and a pressure regulator. You can create more complex\nreactors in the same way, or create multiple connected reactors, each\nwith its own reaction mechanism. \n\nThe example program is in C++, and for now you can only do this in C++.\nBefore long I plan to add these capabilities to the Python and MATLAB\ninterfaces, which will make it much easier to do simulations of CSTRs\nand similar reactors.\n\n\nDave Goodwin\n\n\n"}}
