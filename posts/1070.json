I am trying to \nmodel cata=\r\nlytic combustion of methanol+hydrogen mixture as a \nnonisothermal tubular r=\r\neactor with catlayst distributed uniformly \nalong the length of the reactor=\r\n. I would like to see the temperature \nprofile, concentration of gas and su=\r\nrface species along the length \nof the reactor.\n\nAs a starting point I used=\r\n the catalytic combustion of methane \ndescribed in Cantera&#39;s demos. If I un=\r\nderstand the example correctly, \ngas reactions occur between the inlet and =\r\nPt surface (homogeneous \nchemistry), surface reactions only at Pt surface w=\r\nhich is the last \npoint of the grid (heterogeneous chemistry). Basically, t=\r\nhe surface \nreactions are modeled as a zero-dimensional reactor with surfac=\r\ne \nchemistry. Do I understand it correctly? \n\nI wonder if and how I can use=\r\n the class &#39;Reactor&#39; to incorporate \ncatalyst weight and to get 2D matrix o=\r\nf temperature distribution and \ngas + surface species. Does somebody have a=\r\nn example that I could \napply to my system? or does somebody have a suggest=\r\nion how to go \nabout it so that I can utilize functions already incorporate=\r\nd in \nCantera?\n\nThank you,\n\nLucy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
