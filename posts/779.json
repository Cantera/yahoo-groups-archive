Thermo data \nmay be entered using the &quot;old&quot; NASA polynomial form (7 coefficients), \nor the Shomate form used in the NIST database (also 7 coefficients).   \nThe next version of Cantera will also support the &quot;new&quot; NASA polynomial \nform (9 coefficients).\n\nDave\n\nOn May 2, 2005, at 7:27 AM, tomas_hurtig wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a beginner trying to figure out the temperature limitations on\n&gt; Canteras chemical equilibrium calculations. From what I understand\n&gt; Cantera uses the same data as GRI-Mech 3.0 for these calculations,\n&gt; correct? If so it uses a seven digit polynomial fit of molar heat\n&gt; capacity, entropy and standard enthalpy of formation values and it\n&gt; uses this fit to find values in the temperature range 200K-3000K, \n&gt; correct?\n&gt;\n&gt; My problem is that I need a code that can calculate (in the cases\n&gt; where data exists) up to 20000K, or even higher if possible. I know\n&gt; that this is possible to do with CEA but it would save me a lot of\n&gt; work if I could do it with a program that is Matlab compatible (such\n&gt; as Cantera). Is it at all possible?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;            Tomas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
