Also, if someone has\nexperience ins=\r\ntalling it on OpenSuse in particular, kindly let me know.\n\nWhen I go into t=\r\nhe Cantera folder, I am able to open the configure\nfile for editing. I am n=\r\not sure what I should edit in that file. Also,\nwhen I am done editing, I ca=\r\nnnot run the configure file (by typing in\n./ configure). It would be great =\r\nif someone could address these\nconcerns as well. I have Python 2.5.1 alread=\r\ny installed with OpenSuse\n(comes pre-installed).\n\nThanks\nAtul Bhargav\n\nPhD =\r\nstudent\nMechanical Engineering\nUniversity of Maryland College Park\nMD 20742=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
