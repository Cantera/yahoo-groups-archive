I seem to \n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; running into two problems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 1) When I run with all three input files, the program seems to \n&gt; &gt; run\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; fine, the log file says that the program has been successful and \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n can\n&gt; &gt; see that it has processed the reactions and the thermodynamic \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n data,\n&gt; &gt; but I get no output. The program just sits there and does not \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; return\n&gt; &gt; the output data or the command prompt. 2) The mechanism that =\r\nI am \n&gt; &gt; most interested in using does not have transport data (I don&#39;t \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; need it). The program seems to crash when the\n&gt; &gt; transport file is not =\r\nincluded. If I check the log file it \n&gt; &gt; appears\n&gt; &gt; that everything up th=\r\nrough the thermo data and the mechanism is\n&gt; &gt; successful. Is there a way t=\r\no force the program to not need the\n&gt; &gt; transport data?  Any thoughts on wh=\r\ny this is crashing?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally, I cannot find in the help what is mea=\r\nnt by the option \n&gt; &gt; -id\n&gt; &gt; &lt;identifier&gt;. I am not using this option so p=\r\nerhaps that is my \n&gt; &gt; problem. As a test, I have been trying to convert th=\r\ne mechanisms \n&gt; &gt; given by\n&gt; &gt; livermore as a test and have been unsuccessf=\r\nul with them all. \n&gt; &gt; http://www-cms.llnl.gov/combustion/combustion2.html\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone has any advice, I would be most grateful.
