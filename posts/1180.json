I know that it is possible to implement \nhea=\r\nt transfer as a function of time, but is it possible to take the \nreactor t=\r\nemperature at each iteration step, then apply a heat loss \nfunction that us=\r\nes that temperature before calculating the next step.\n\nAnyone have any expe=\r\nrience with such things?\n\nMany thanks in advance,\n\nAdam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
