What I am looking for are any converged, resolved flame \nsolutions from Chemkin 2, including:\n\n1) PREMIX or OPPDIFF input files\n2) reaction mechanism and thermo data files in Chemkin format\n3) computed species and temperature profiles in some text file format\n\nI am particularly interested in non-trivial flames with large \nmechanisms or at atmospheric pressure or above (but any flame is \nuseful).  I would also like to have examples both with mixture-averaged \nand multicomponent diffusion.  If you have this information for some \nflame or flames, please send me a tar or zip file with the files listed \nabove.  I will take this information, generate the corresponding \nCantera input files + python script, and compare the computed profiles \n(unless you want to do that too...).  I would plan on then sending back \nto you the Cantera files, so that you could run a Cantera vs. Chemkin 2 \ntiming comparison on the same machine.\n\nBased on previous comparisons of thermo properties, transport \nproperties, and kinetic rates, I fully expect excellent agreement in \nthe steady-state flame profiles, with substantial improvement in \nperformance.  But a head-to-head flame comparison would be very \ninteresting, and would provide assurance to users converting from the \nChemkin 2 codes that Cantera produces the same output, given the same \ninput.\n\nThis will be most useful if we can get at least several flames from \ndifferent groups, running on different machines, etc.\nIf you have been wanting to contribute to the development of Cantera \nand its acceptance by the combustion community, but aren&#39;t an expert in \nC++/Python, etc., here&#39;s a good opportunity to do so!\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
