(Also, it occurs \nto me that it might be useful to have the lightweight objects \ncarry around the handle to their corresponding heavyweight \nobject, so I can use the heavyweight in subfunctions without \nhaving to explicitly pass it.)\n\nI can imagine that it would be most convenient to have Cantera&#39;s \nown classes set up so that I can define something like &quot;f = air&quot; \nand then define &quot;g = copy(f)&quot;, and have it create an f and g that \nhave individual state data but share the same reaction data.  \nHowever, this is certainly something that can be approximated \nquite closely on the user end by defining lightweight structures \nas you suggest, so it certainly isn&#39;t something I&#39;d consider to be \neither necessary or urgent.\n\nIt also occurs to me that it might be worth including something \nillustrating the creation of lightweight objects to handle multiple \nstates and copying thereof in the tutorials.  Would you consider \nthat worth including if I were to write such a thing?\n\n- Brooks\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Brooks -\n&gt; \n&gt; I would recommend that you consider changing your code to avoid making  \n&gt; multiple copies of class Solution objects. The reason is that these are  \n&gt; &quot;heavyweights&quot; - each one contains all reaction mechanism data.  So an  \n&gt; alternative would be to create a single heavyweight object, and many  \n&gt; &quot;lightweight&quot; ones that are pure Matlab objects or structures that just  \n&gt; hold state information (temperature, density or pressure, + mass  \n&gt; fractions). Then pass the lightweight objects to your functions, to set  \n&gt; the initial state for a calculation. Something like this:\n[...]\n\n\n\n"}}
