First, thanks again for all of\nyour work on this project.  At the Symposium in Japan, I was telling\neveryone who would listen that I thought Cantera was the next big thing in\ncombustion modeling, and after getting a bit more serious in the last few\ndays, I am more convinced.\n\nI believe I told you that my interest fell into two categories.  First, we\nare interested in diffusion flame chemistry, and creating a 1-D flame (and\nthen, hopefully, 2-D)  is my goal.  In the short term, I have been\ninterested in &quot;porting&quot; to Delphi, a language much more popular in the\nscientific community in Europe than it is here.  That all might change, as\nKYLIX, the version of Delphi that runs on LINUX, grows in popularity.\n\nTeh ports can take a few different paths.  Unfortunately  the way C++ does\nclasses is just different enough from how Delphi does Object Classes, that\nsome work is needed in the transition.  (&quot;Flattening&quot; seems to be the\npopular verb for this.) From what I can tell, this is what you have done for\nthe MATLAB interface.  This might be the ultimate solution, but not trivial.\n(The challenge is creating an interface to the DLL from the important header\nfiles.)\n\nIn the short term, I have found a set of Delphi components called &quot;Python\nfor Delphi&quot; that provides an easy interface between Python scripts and the\nGUI of Delphi.  I have written a &quot;wrapper&quot; for the 1-D premix code that\nprovides visual tools for setting up a flame calculation, running it, and\nplotting the results (without leaving the program.)  As I clean this up,\nthis might be a useful tool for others in the users group, particularly as\nan educational tool.  Let me know if this is of interest and I will clean it\nup and send it out to you.\n\nMy question of the day is this: how hard would it be to set up the\ncpounterflow problem (either premixed or non-premixed.)?  Is this something\nyou have already started in on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Dave Goodwin&quot; &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;cantera@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 06, 2002 8:54 AM\nSubject: [cantera] Short-term Research Position at Caltech\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I am looking for someone to work on a new DARPA-funded collaborative\n&gt; program between Prof. Bill Goddard (Chemistry, Caltech), myself, and\n&gt; a couple of others. The work will involve developing methods to\n&gt; extract reduced reaction mechanisms for energetic materials directly\n&gt; from reactive molecular dynamics simulation data, and will involve\n&gt; working closely with the Goddard group.\n&gt;\n&gt; The position is available immediately. Unfortunately this is a short-\n&gt; duration program, and will likely end at the end of July, 2003.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are interested in spending half a year or so at Caltech, and\n&gt; have experience in kinetics, computational methods, etc., please let\n&gt; me know off-line (dgoodwin@...) and I can provide more\n&gt; information.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; cantera-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
