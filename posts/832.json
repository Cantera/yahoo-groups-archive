I am using cantera \nprimarily for kinetics and thermo calculations.\n\nI have a couple questions about handling bulk phases.  So far I&#39;ve \ndefined an interface with a gas phase, several adsorbed surface \nspecies, and two bulk phases (one for oxide ions in the electrolyte, \nand one for oxide vacancies in the electrolyte).  My questions are:\n\n-is there any way to combine the two bulk phases into one phase?  \nCreating a stoichiometric solid seems to only allow one species.\n\n-for reactions involving the oxide ions or vacancies in the \nelectrolyte, the rates should obviously depend on the concentrations \nof said species.  How can this concentration be changed?  I&#39;ve tried \nchanging the phase density, both in the cti file and \nthrough &#39;setDensity&#39; in the Matlab interface, but the results of the \ncall to &#39;netprodrates(interface)&#39; remain unchanged.\n\nCan anyone please help?  \n\n\nThanks,\nSteven DeCaluwe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
