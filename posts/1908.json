But this doesn&#39;t matter, if the energy equation was\nsolv=\r\ned in conservative form.  My understanding of this bug is that the\nentire t=\r\nrouble stems from the discretization of the term involving the\nflux of sens=\r\nible enthalpy for each individual species, the term\ninvolving c_p,k in the =\r\nenergy equation.  One would need to ensure\nconservation of energy at each c=\r\nell interface.   In this case, once\nthe calculation is done, the enthalpy o=\r\nf the products should be\nEXACTLY equal to the enthalpy of the reactants on =\r\nANY grid, since in\nthe reactants and products, the diffusional fluxes vanis=\r\nh and pressure\nis imposed constant.\n\nmatei\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;avmokhov&quot; &lt;avmokhov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; Last two days I was tryi=\r\nng to solve this problem. Indeed, for a free \n&gt; hydrogen/air flame Cantera =\r\ncalculates temperatures substantially \n&gt; lower than adiabatic ones (differe=\r\nnce can be 40 K for a coarse grid). \n&gt; It happens when multicomponent trans=\r\nport is used. For a mixture-\n&gt; averaged model calculations are fine. Refini=\r\nng grid helps a little \n&gt; bit - difference decreases down to 20 K when numb=\r\ner of grid points \n&gt; approaches 300. Further refinement is impossible: Cant=\r\nera has \n&gt; problems with the noise when approximating derivatives. It seems=\r\n for \n&gt; me that something is nor correct with calculations of diffusion \n&gt; =\r\nterms. I did not dig in the code to check equations but it is \n&gt; probably d=\r\nue to artificial diffusion on a coarse mesh. What \n&gt; differences are used t=\r\no approximate derivatives?
