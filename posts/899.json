To do this, I use \nequilibrate(gas,HP) to determine the equilibrium molar mass for a \ngiven set of input conditions, and then have reactor iterate until\nthe molar mass of the gas is within 1% of this value and record the \nend time.  I have a loop set up to run this procedure at many \ndifferent temperatures and save all the data in an excell file.  The \nproblem is that equilibrate often returns the &quot;no convergence in 1000\niterations&quot; error, which stops all the calculations and keeps the \ndata from being saved.  It is puzzling because equilibrate only \nsometimes returns the error.  If I run equilibrate over and over \nwithout changing any of the input conditions, it sometimes reaches a\nsolution, and sometimes returns the error.  It seems that I either \nneed some way to increase the maximum number of iterations, or a way \nto tell Cantera to rerun equilibrate until it reaches a solution, as \nopposed to stopping entirely.  Are either one of these options \npossible?  \nThank you very much, and have a great Independence Day.\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n"}}
