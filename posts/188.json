This is a major release \n&gt; with many new capabilities; if you are using Cantera on a Windows \nPC, I \n&gt; encourage you to upgrade to 1.5.\n&gt; \n&gt; The release includes:\n&gt; - demos in MATLAB, Python, Fortran 77, and C++ (all have been \ntested \n&gt; and are now working)\n&gt; - compiled Cantera libraries (both debug and release versions) for \n&gt; linking to Fortran or C++ applications\n&gt; - all Cantera C++ header files\n&gt; - a converter program to convert Chemkin reaction mechanism files \nto \n&gt; the new Cantera format\n&gt; - PowerPoint presentations covering installation, building Fortran \n&gt; applications, and the Python and MATLAB demos\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the examples are premixed burner-stabilized flames, detached \n&gt; stagnation-point flames, non-premixed counterflow flames, catalytic \n&gt; combustion in stagnation flow, a CVD problem with elementary \nsurface \n&gt; chemistry, zero-D reactors with surface chemistry, ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you enjoy it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave G.\n\n\n"}}
