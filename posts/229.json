Until now, I&#39;ve been working \nFortran77 and Chemkin. As an excercise, I converted my old Fortran77 \ncode (pyrol.f) so that it now calls subprograms of Cantera instead of \nthose of Chemkin. But three of the subprograms (getMolecularWeights\n(), SpeciesIndex() and getEnthalpy_RT()) called in pyrol.f are not \nexplained in the manual f77.pdf. I found them in another manual \n(cantera12_f90.pdf), but it doesn&#39;t tell me how to include them in \nFortran77-Cantera interface file (pyrol_ftnlib.cpp). I just made a \nguess to add them in cpp file, based on usage of other subprograms \nincluded in the manual, and I tried to compile them, but it failed \nwith error messages related to those subprograms: Actually, I didn&#39;t \nsee any error message on one of them, getEnthalpy_RT(), so this one \nmay be correct. \n\nCould you please see the following, which is parts of pyrol.f and \npyrol_ftnlib.cpp, and tell me how I should revise it? Thanks in \nadvance. \n\nc Fortran77 commands in  pyrol.f\n      DIMENSION x(10),y(10)\n      parameter (nwt=101,nh=201)\n      call getMolecularWeights(x)\n      ic2h2=SpeciesIndex(&#39;C2H2&#39;)\n      call getEnthalpy_RT(y)\n\n\n// C++ commands in  pyrol_ftnlib.cpp\n    void getmolecularweights_(doublereal* molwts) {\n        _gas-&gt;getMolecularWeights(molwts);\n    }\n\n    integer speciesindex_(char* X, ftnlen lenx) {\n        return _gas-&gt;SpeciesIndex_(string(X, lenx));\n    }\n\n    void getenthalpy_rt_(doublereal* x) {\n        _gas-&gt;getEnthalpy_RT(x);\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
