In the program we set the \ntemperature to 1001K and Pressure to OneAtm and also specify the \nnumber of moles of H2:2, O2:1, N2:4. After this the gas is inserted \nin the reactor and a simulation is carried out. My question is the \nreactor volume is given a default value of 1m3 at the beginning of \nthe simulation. My question is when we have set the temperature, \npressure and number of moles inserted in the reactor, shouldnt the \nreactor have a volume different from the default value of 1m3? \n(approximately the value obtained from the ideal gas formula?)\n\nSurinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
