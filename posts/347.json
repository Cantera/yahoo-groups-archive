I would \nlike to enlist a few interested people to help with the logistics and \nplanning.  I will be contacting some of you who have volunteered your \nservices for this in a few days.  The time, location, duration, and \nagenda are all to be determined.  My inclination is to make it a \nhalf-day workshop, but nothing has been decided yet.  Stay tuned for \nmore details...\n\nAlso, a new release will come out very soon, possibly by the end of the \nweek.  The major new features are significantly enhanced capabilities \nto do reactor network simulations, along with much improved \ndocumentation, and built-in accurate liquid/vapor equations of state \nfor several fluids, including water/steam.\n\n\n\n"}}
