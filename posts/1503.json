I got a pretty good sample code off of this board that I was \nable to mo=\r\ndify for what I need. However when running in Matlab, it \nhas trouble with =\r\nthe setVelocity function. It seems to not recognize \nit at all. Does anybod=\r\ny know what to do to make this work? It works \nfine in Python though.\n\nAlso=\r\n, the velocity that you specify in the function. What is the \nformat of thi=\r\ns veocity. In the example, it uses a Fourier series to \nget the velocity. C=\r\nan this just be a vector input? And also can you \nsimply specify the veloci=\r\nty at each timestep, so that you could \nincorporate the kinetics model into=\r\n an ICE model that I already have \nin simulink and compute things in real-t=\r\nime as the model runs. Or \nwould it have to be given the complete piston ve=\r\nlocity data prior to \nadvancing the reactor network?\n\nThanks for any help!!=\r\n\n\nClint Bedick\nWest Virginia University\nMechanical Engineering PhD Student\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
