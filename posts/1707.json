I&#39;ll have to look into kintecus a little \nm=\r\nore.  It looks like Kilpinen et. al have done a fair amount of work \nwith b=\r\niomass.  Their mechanism, however does not appear to have \nspecies such as =\r\na cellulose monomer or lignin which are essential to \nmodeling partial oxid=\r\nation of biomass.  \n\nPaul\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrew Mackro=\r\nry&quot; \n&lt;andrew.mackrory@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The Kintecus chemical simulation soft=\r\nware available at\n&gt; http://www.kintecus.com/  has a mechanism available for=\r\n it that may \nbe\n&gt; useful to you.
