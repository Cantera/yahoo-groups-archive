The link found on \nthe &quot;documentation&quot; page at cantera.org is not working.  This link is:\n\nhttp://rayleigh.cds.caltech.edu/%7Egoodwin/cantera/python/Cantera.html\n\nI am new to cantera and python and would like some examples to learn \nfrom.  I am looking to use cantera to do some rough calculations \ninvolving adsorption of vapor phase Hg on various supports (the Hg \nwill react with surface functional groups to form a stable surface \nspecies).\n\nIf anyone can provide any examples or lead me to a site where the \nexamples that used to be held in the link above can be found, I would \ngreatly appreciate it.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDalton York\n\n\n\n"}}
