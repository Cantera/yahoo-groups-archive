The biggest challenge will be coming up with a kinetic \nmechan=\r\nism.  Most of the mechanisms available describe combustion of \nhydrocarbons=\r\n and typically don&#39;t include molecules typical of biomass \ngasification (i.=\r\ne. large oxygenated cyclic compounds).  \n\nCantera is a tool for modeling re=\r\naction kinetics, but it needs input \nfrom the user (in the form of the kine=\r\ntic mechanism) to tell it which \nreactions to consider and what their rates=\r\n are.  \n\nIf you find a mechanism that&#39;s already been developed I&#39;d love to =\r\n\nhear about it. \n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lorenzo_damiani&quot; \n&lt;loren=\r\nzo_damiani@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a PhD Student, and I am working=\r\n on biomass gasification \n&gt; modeling. A colleague told me about Cantera, an=\r\nd described it as a \n&gt; powerful device for reactors modeling: I downloaded =\r\nit immediately!\n&gt; \n&gt; As I am intended to implement a kinetic model for biom=\r\nass \n&gt; gasification, I would like to understand what is the best way to do =\r\n\n&gt; it, and which functions may I re-utilize among the many in the \n&gt; Canter=\r\na toolbox. \n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is: I would like to construct a 1 dimensional =\r\nmodel \nable \n&gt; to reproduce the temperature, velocity and composition profi=\r\nles \nalong \n&gt; the axis of the reactor as the gas flows through the active s=\r\nurface \n&gt; of charcoal. Should I use a single reactor containing ODE solutio=\r\nn \n&gt; along the axial co-ordinate or should I link many 0-D reactors \n&gt; toge=\r\nther?\n&gt; What about chemical reactions modeling? Mainly, the model should \nw=\r\nork \n&gt; with the following reactions:\n&gt; \n&gt; C+2H2&lt;=3D&gt;CH4 ; C+CO2&lt;=3D&gt;2CO; C+=\r\nH2O&lt;=3D&gt;CO+H2; CH4+H2O&lt;=3D&gt;CO+3H2\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there in the Cantera tools a kine=\r\ntic model for these reactions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, is there something that I can=\r\n use to implement a model of \n&gt; biomass pyrolysis?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your =\r\nhelp!\n&gt; \n&gt; Lorenzo\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
