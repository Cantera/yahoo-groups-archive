Installed Python 2.5\n&gt; 2. Ran the canter=\r\na msi\n&gt; 3. Ran the cantera setup from the cantera folder\n&gt; 4. When I double=\r\n-clicked on a python script a DOS console window \n&gt; flashed on the screen (=\r\nno error message)\n&gt; 5. If I right click on a script and then choose to edit=\r\n the script \n&gt; and then try to run it from the python console:\n&gt;    ImportE=\r\nrror: No module named numarray.libnumeric\n&gt; 6. The offending line in the sc=\r\nript is &quot;import from Cantera *&quot;\n&gt; 7. So I found the libnumeric installer fo=\r\nr python 2.5 and installed \n&gt; it.\n&gt; 8. Same problem.\n&gt; 9. Searched for answ=\r\ners in the forum, haven&#39;t found any (yet)\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone used winxp and py=\r\nthon 2.5 and the cantera 1.7 msi and got \n&gt; it to work? If so, how did you =\r\ndo it? The installation instructions \n&gt; just say to run the installer. I fo=\r\nund answers for matlab, but I \n&gt; don&#39;t have that, nor do I have a complier =\r\n(at least under winxp) so I \n&gt; need to get the winxp installer working with=\r\n python.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know next to nothing about python, so how do I tell if libn=\r\numeric \n&gt; is properly installed? I didn&#39;t see anything obvious on a quick \n=\r\n&gt; glance of the python directory structure.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
