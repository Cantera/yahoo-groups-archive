The Python interface is documented.  If you  \nare using Windows, on the Start menu under &quot;Python&quot; there is an  \noption to view module documentation; select this and navigate to  \nCantera, then look at class Reactor. On unix or mac, type &quot;pydoc -g&quot;  \nfrom the command line to access the Python documentation.  Also,  \nthere are several working demo scripts that show how to do zero-D  \nreactor simulations. Take a look in demos/python/reactors (or if you  \nhave the Cantera source code, these are in Cantera/python/examples/ \nreactors).\n\nDave\n\nOn May 14, 2007, at 7:49 AM, Werner wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; is there something like a documentation to the fortran 77/90 interface\n&gt; to cantera for the current version?
