So \nalthough Cantera supports using the size parameter for surface species, \nit would have to be added by hand to the CTML file, since it is not \nunderstood in the CTI file.  This has now been fixed, so you can check \nout from CVS the latest version of ctml_writer.py \n(&#39;Cantera/python/ctml_writer.py&#39; in the repository) and simply replace \nthe version you have in your Cantera Python package with the new \nversion.  I haven&#39;t had need to use the &#39;size&#39; parameter, and I guess \nno one else has either until now!\n\nSteven - your suggested work-around might work, but also might give \nundesired behavior. The &#39;ads(S)&#39; species would contain twice the number \nof atoms as S, but since its &#39;size&#39; is 1, the site density would be the \nsame as S.  This would affect the way the conversion from coverage to \nsurface concentration is done.\n\nI have found that it is all too easy to write a surface reaction that \ndoes not conserve surface sites, and then strange things start to \nhappen.  As an added check to help Cantera flag reactions that don&#39;t \nconserve sites, I often define an &#39;element&#39; corresponding to each site \ntype.  For example, a CTI file might look like this:\n\n---------------------------\nelement(&#39;&#39;surf_site&#39;)\n...\nspecies(name = &#39;S&#39;, atoms = &#39;surf_site:1&#39;, ...)\n\nspecies(name = &#39;ads(S)&#39;, atoms = &#39;surf_site:2&#39;, size = 2, ...)\n---------------------------\n\nBy declaring that ads(S) contains 2 &#39;atoms&#39; of &#39;surf_site&#39;, Cantera \nwill be able to check any reaction containing it for site conservation. \n  The size parameter must also be supplied to do concentration &lt;-&gt; \ncoverage conversion correctly.\n\nAn &#39;element&#39; declaration with no atomic weight is assigned a very small \nbut non-zero atomic weight, to avoid problems with dividing by zero in \nmass/mole conversion. You can use this to define anything you want to \nconserve in a reaction (sites, spin, ...), without measurably affecting \nmolecular weights.\nIf species are defined that contain only these &#39;virtual&#39; elements, \ncorresponding to an empty site, then mass fractions for these will be \nnearly zero, but it is better to describe surface species in molar, not \nmass, terms anyway.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Dec 16, 2005, at 12:27 PM, Steven C. DeCaluwe wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Paul,\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like you should be able to dictate the size of your surface\n&gt; species in the reaction equation.  Wouldn&#39;t the reaction equation\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; ads + 2 S =&gt; ads(S) &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; give Cantera all the info it needs in terms of the &#39;size&#39; attribute\n&gt; (where &#39;ads&#39; is the unbound species, &#39;S&#39; an empty surface site, and\n&gt; ads(S) the bound species)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Your definition for the species &#39;ads(S)&#39; would have to include all\n&gt; the atoms in &#39;S&#39; (times two), but unless there&#39;s something I&#39;m not\n&gt; thinking of, I think this would have the same effect as declaring\n&gt; &#39;size = 2.&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; Steven\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- peyelvington &lt;pyelvington@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Dave and Group,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to use the &quot;size&quot; attribute of a species to specify the\n&gt;&gt; number of sites that a surface-bound species occupies (n_k in eqn.\n&gt;&gt; 3.4\n&gt;&gt; of the &quot;Defining Phases and Intefaces&quot;).
