From my\n&gt; knowledge of mass balancing the i=\r\nnitial concentration must be 0 for\n&gt; water, and the concentrations at z=3D0=\r\n unequal to zero should be only\n&gt; those of the educts hydrogen, oxygen and =\r\nthe inertial gas argon. \n&gt; I&#39;ve used the unaltered script flame1.py of cant=\r\nera-1.6.0, varied only\n&gt; the pressure within 0.03-1 atm. A similar behaviou=\r\nr is observable for\n&gt; CK II running premixed H2-O2-Ar flames or C2H2-O2-fla=\r\nmes, but this is\n&gt; no CK II group, but interesting for me (some form of oo-=\r\ninheritance?-).\n&gt; \n&gt; Textbooks about combustion (Warnatz et al.) show graph=\r\ns with initial\n&gt; water concentrations of zero. \n&gt; Is something wrong in my =\r\ninterpretation of the results in flame1.csv? \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards from German=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; Holger    \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
