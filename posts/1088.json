I replaced my ctml_writer.py with th=\r\ne\nnew version and my test case is working now. I was trying to reproduce\nth=\r\ne classic chemkin surface reaction example case (Si3N4 deposition)\ndiscusse=\r\nd in the Surface Chemkin documentation. I&#39;m fairly\ninexperienced with surfa=\r\nce chemistry, so I was doing this as a\nlearning exercise. The results with =\r\nCantera match the Chemkin results\nvery well. If you&#39;re interested in anothe=\r\nr chemkin comparision, I can\nsend you the files. Thanks again.\n\nThanks also=\r\n to Steven for the suggested work-around.\n\nBest,\n\nPaul\n\n--- In cantera@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul -\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I d=\r\non&#39;t know how it got left out, but the &#39;size&#39; attribute was \n&gt; missing from=\r\n the &#39;ctml_writer.py&#39; module that ct2ctml uses.  So \n&gt; although Cantera sup=\r\nports using the size parameter for surface species, \n&gt; it would have to be =\r\nadded by hand to the CTML file, since it is not \n&gt; understood in the CTI fi=\r\nle.  This has now been fixed, so you can check \n&gt; out from CVS the latest v=\r\nersion of ctml_writer.py \n&gt; (&#39;Cantera/python/ctml_writer.py&#39; in the reposit=\r\nory) and simply replace \n&gt; the version you have in your Cantera Python pack=\r\nage with the new \n&gt; version.  I haven&#39;t had need to use the &#39;size&#39; paramete=\r\nr, and I guess \n&gt; no one else has either until now!\n&gt; \n&gt; Steven - your sugg=\r\nested work-around might work, but also might give \n&gt; undesired behavior. Th=\r\ne &#39;ads(S)&#39; species would contain twice the number \n&gt; of atoms as S, but sin=\r\nce its &#39;size&#39; is 1, the site density would be the \n&gt; same as S.  This would=\r\n affect the way the conversion from coverage to \n&gt; surface concentration is=\r\n done.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have found that it is all too easy to write a surface reactio=\r\nn that \n&gt; does not conserve surface sites, and then strange things start to=\r\n \n&gt; happen.  As an added check to help Cantera flag reactions that don&#39;t \n&gt;=\r\n conserve sites, I often define an &#39;element&#39; corresponding to each site \n&gt; =\r\ntype.  For example, a CTI file might look like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------=\r\n----------\n&gt; element(&#39;&#39;surf_site&#39;)\n&gt; ...\n&gt; species(name =3D &#39;S&#39;, atoms =3D =\r\n&#39;surf_site:1&#39;, ...)\n&gt; \n&gt; species(name =3D &#39;ads(S)&#39;, atoms =3D &#39;surf_site:2&#39;=\r\n, size =3D 2, ...)\n&gt; ---------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; By declaring that ads=\r\n(S) contains 2 &#39;atoms&#39; of &#39;surf_site&#39;, Cantera \n&gt; will be able to check any=\r\n reaction containing it for site conservation. \n&gt;   The size parameter must=\r\n also be supplied to do concentration &lt;-&gt; \n&gt; coverage conversion correctly.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; An &#39;element&#39; declaration with no atomic weight is assigned a very sma=\r\nll \n&gt; but non-zero atomic weight, to avoid problems with dividing by zero i=\r\nn \n&gt; mass/mole conversion. You can use this to define anything you want to =\r\n\n&gt; conserve in a reaction (sites, spin, ...), without measurably affecting =\r\n\n&gt; molecular weights.\n&gt; If species are defined that contain only these &#39;vir=\r\ntual&#39; elements, \n&gt; corresponding to an empty site, then mass fractions for =\r\nthese will be \n&gt; nearly zero, but it is better to describe surface species =\r\nin molar, not \n&gt; mass, terms anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 16, 2005, =\r\nat 12:27 PM, Steven C.
