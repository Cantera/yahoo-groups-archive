In order to run\n&gt; cantera using c++, and not python or matlab, is it possible to write\n&gt; routines that use these libraries directly, and not have to install\n&gt; cantera using a .msi file? Basically working without the additional\n&gt; overhead.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Is it necessary to have visual fortran to build cantera, if fortran\n&gt; files are not to be used. I have read that some parts of Cantera use\n&gt; fortran based code, requiring a fortran compiler during build.\n&gt; I just want to know if Cantera can be completely built using visual\n&gt; studio alone.\n&gt;\n&gt; I intend to post instructions on how to setup and use Cantera from c++\n&gt; alone using this free Express version. This would be of interest to\n&gt; many that only want to use c++ with cantera.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance to any repliers,\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Adam.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
