But then, further on,\nthe latter variable is u=\r\nsed in an if statement with test -n:\n\nif test -n ${BUILD_F90}; then\n\nwhich =\r\nwill always result in true. If I&#39;m not mistaken, it should read\n\nif [ $BUIL=\r\nD_F90 =3D 1 ]; then\n\n\nThis concerns the source package of version 1.6.0.\n\n\n=\r\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
