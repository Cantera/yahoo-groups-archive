So, it seems to me that this can be an explanation for \nthe differen=\r\nces: Cantera probably implements the sticking \ncoefficients without Motz-Wi=\r\nse correction.\nDaniela\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chitral_naik&quot; &lt;chi=\r\ntral_naik@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am wondering if sticking coefficie=\r\nnts are implemented and \nevaluated\n&gt; differently in Cantera than that in Ch=\r\nemkin.
