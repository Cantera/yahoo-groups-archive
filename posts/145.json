Both of these models apply  \nonly to ideal gas mixtures.\n\nTo use the mixture-averaged model, do this:\n\ngas = GRI30(&#39;Mix&#39;)\n\nTo use multicomponent properties, do this:\n\ngas = GRI30(&#39;Multi&#39;)\n\nIn either case, functions like\n\nviscosity(gas)\n\nshould work as long as a transport model has been specified.  The error  \nmessage you are getting is strange; it should complain about not having  \nspecified a transport model.\n\nAt some point, I plan to restructure the transport property routines,  \nso that the two ideal gas transport models are integrated, and  \ninitialization happens automatically the first time any transport  \nproperty is requested. But for now, you need to remember to specify  \n&#39;Mix&#39; or &#39;Multi&#39;.\n\nYou are right about setState_HP.  The incorrect line is Python syntax,  \nbut is not understood by Matlab. This was corrected a while back, and  \nshould not be a problem in the current version. You might want to  \ninstall the latest version, or wait until later in the week when I  \nrelease the version that includes support for flames in Matlab.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, May 31, 2003, at 10:36 AM, patcaton75 wrote:\n\n&gt; 1). I believe I must have missed something basic during Cantera\n&gt; installation, otherwise more people would be having this problem. I\n&gt; cannot access any of the transport properties through Cantera. Typical\n&gt; command line prompts as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt; gas = GRI30;\n&gt; viscosity(gas)\n&gt;\n&gt; ??? Undefined function or variable &#39;getCanteraError&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; c:&#92;documents and settings&#92;mm&#92;my\n&gt; documents&#92;cantera-1.3&#92;cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;viscosity.m\n&gt; On line 4  ==&gt;    error(getCanteraError);\n&gt;\n&gt; Similar errors occur for all other transport properties.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2). I also found what seems to be an obvious error in the m-file code\n&gt; for setState_HP.m. After my installation of the matlab toolbox, this\n&gt; file had the following line in it:\n&gt;\n&gt; h, p = hp;\n&gt;\n&gt; which is simply improper syntax for matlab. In fact, the line wasn&#39;t\n&gt; really necessary, and removing the line and slightly modifying the\n&gt; next allowed the setState_HP command to properly function. I&#39;m\n&gt; confused/concerned that my installation seems to be the only one with\n&gt; such an error. Has this been seen before?\n&gt;\n&gt; Any assistance you can provide will be appreciated. I am using Cantera\n&gt; v. 1.3; I installed the Matlab toolbox in March, 2003.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
