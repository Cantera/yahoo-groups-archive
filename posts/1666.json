However, it is your choice. \nI glanced in your =\r\ncode and found a few things, which can result in \nthis strange behavior. Fi=\r\nrst, in the simulation loop your create \nevery time the object gx on a heap=\r\n with the operator new without \ndestroying it. Usually it is very bad idea;=\r\n an object, created with \nnew operator should be implicitly destroyed by op=\r\nerator delete, \notherwise memory leakage is possible. Second, it is not nec=\r\nessary to \ncreate new gas object every time, you can use the same gas objec=\r\nt for \nall reactors. Third, you create at every loop iteration a new \nReact=\r\norNet object, while IMHO you should only add a new reactor to \nthe same Rea=\r\nctorNet object on every step. \n\nHope it will help.   \nBest regards, Anatoli=\r\n.\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, Daniele Chiappini \n&lt;daniele.chiappini@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; avmokhov ha scritto:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Daniele,\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, I did not un=\r\nderstand you correctly. I thought that you \nchanged\n&gt; &gt; thermodynamic prope=\r\nrties of some components such as a heat of \nformation\n&gt; &gt; etc. But now I do=\r\nn&#39;t understand why do you use the Reactors \nNetwork to\n&gt; &gt; simulate heat lo=\r\nsses in a piston. You can do it very easy with one\n&gt; &gt; reactor, changing th=\r\ne heat transfer coefficient. Even you can \nintroduce\n&gt; &gt; an arbitrary time-=\r\ndependent function for heat losses.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards, Anatoli\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; Dear Anatoli,\n&gt; I know I can do it, but for my research topic I&#39;m develo=\r\nping a 1-D \nheat \n&gt; transfer\n&gt; mechanism and I would prefer coupling with a=\r\n adiabatic reactor \nwhich I \n&gt; re-initialize\n&gt; every timestep, although it&#39;=\r\ns more complicated . Prof. Goodwin also \n&gt; wrote me about\n&gt; the function &quot;r=\r\neinitialize&quot; in CVODE, but I haven&#39;t found a \nreference \n&gt; about it yet.\n&gt; =\r\nDo you have suggestions about it?\n&gt; Best regards, Daniele\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Doc=\r\n.
