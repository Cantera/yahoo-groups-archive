Instructions \non how to do this are there also.  In general this is the best thing to \ndo for anyone building Cantera from the source, since then you always \nhave essentially the same version I have, including features not yet in \nthe official release. This also allows immediately correcting any bugs, \nrather than having to wait for the next release.\n\nFor this reason, anyone who has access to a unix / linux / Mac OSX \nmachine with the usual GNU tools may want to consider using Cantera \nthere, where it can be built from the source and kept up to date more \neasily than on a Windows PC.  (However, if you are building Cantera \nfrom the source on Windows, you can also use CVS to check out the \nlatest files. )\n\nAbout the specific missing file - it may be that file &#39;reactors.h&#39; used \nin that example was added after the last source release. It should be \nin the CVS repository.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn May 4, 2004, at 6:38 AM, kvirgilm wrote:\n\n&gt; I am trying to get the CSTR example that is posted on this site to\n&gt; work.
