It was found and fixed a while back, but either the bug  \nfix didn&#39;t make it into the version posted on the web, or you installed  \nan earlier version. In any case, I will be releasing a new version this  \nweek that will have this fixed and also will have a few new things. In  \nthe meantime, you can remove any line where &#39;reset&#39; is being called on  \na MassFlowController object, or else edit file flowControllers.py to  \nadd a dummy &#39;reset&#39; method to class MassFlowController.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Friday, April 11, 2003, at 12:56 PM, gilberto_rozenchan wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to use the MassFlowController between a reservoir and a\n&gt; reactor, but I keep getting the error message &quot;MassFlowController\n&gt; instance has no attribute &#39;reset&#39;&quot;, pointing to file Reactor.py as\n&gt; the source of the error. I tried removing the line &quot;self.reset()&quot;\n&gt; from the &quot;install&quot; definition at that file, but it doesn&#39;t seem to\n&gt; work.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reset function is only used for pressure regulators, which are\n&gt; disabled in the Reactor module. The above-mentioned problem also\n&gt; happens for Valves. What should I do to fix this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Gilberto\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
