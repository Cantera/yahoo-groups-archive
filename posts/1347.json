Huckaby and D.

From my\n&gt; knowledge of mass balancing the initial concentration =\r\nmust be 0 for\n&gt; water, and the concentrations at z=3D0 unequal to zero shou=\r\nld be only\n&gt; those of the educts hydrogen, oxygen and the inertial gas argo=\r\nn. \n&gt; I&#39;ve used the unaltered script flame1.py of cantera-1.6.0, varied onl=\r\ny\n&gt; the pressure within 0.03-1 atm. A similar behaviour is observable for\n&gt;=\r\n CK II running premixed H2-O2-Ar flames or C2H2-O2-flames, but this is\n&gt; no=\r\n CK II group, but interesting for me (some form of oo-inheritance?-). \n&gt; Te=\r\nxtbooks about combustion (Warnatz et al.) show graphs with initial\n&gt; water =\r\nconcentrations of zero. \n&gt; Is something wrong in my interpretation of the r=\r\nesults in flame1.csv? \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards from Germany\n&gt; \n&gt; Holger\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
