I mean=\r\n, instead of give the\n&gt; &gt; composition as:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; gas.set(T =3D 900.0, P =\r\n=3D 1.0e5, X =3D &#39;CH4:1,O2:2,N2:7.52&#39;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We could give something like=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; gas1.set(T =3D 900.0, P =3D 1.0e5, X =3D\n&gt; &gt; &#39;CH4:mole_CH4,O2:mol=\r\ne_O2,N2:mole_N2&#39;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Where mole_CH4, mole_O2 and mole_N2 are previousl=\r\ny calculated as a\n&gt; &gt; function of the fuel injection rate, mass air flow an=\r\nd equivalence\n&gt; &gt; ratio. Any hint or experience on this will be much apprec=\r\niated.\nThank\n&gt; &gt; you very much for your kind attention.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regard=\r\ns, Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo=\r\n!
