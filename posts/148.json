This function has the effect of  \n&gt; expanding the volume whenever the pressure goes slightly above the  \n&gt; setpoint, and contracting it when it goes below, thereby forcing \nthe  \n&gt; pressure to stay very close to the setpoint value.  The \ncoefficient  \n&gt; should be set to a value large enough so that the pressure \ndeviations  \n&gt; are sufficiently small, but not so large that numerical problems \noccur.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, while this all works, reactor_ode.m is the old way of \ndoing  \n&gt; kinetics simulations.  The new way is to use class Reactor.  There  \n&gt; should be examples of how to do this in the &#39;demo&#39; folder.\n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave G.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wednesday, June 4, 2003, at 12:59 PM, y2kpac wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the suggested matlab code for the function vdot.m (which is \ncalled\n&gt; &gt; by reactor_ode.m), volume change to keep constant pressure is\n&gt; &gt; calculated by\n&gt; &gt; v = 1.e11 * (pressure(gas) - 101325);\n&gt; &gt; The comments specify that this is valid only for 1 atm.  What \nabout\n&gt; &gt; isobaric processes at other pressures?  How is the coefficient \n1.e11\n&gt; &gt; calculated?
