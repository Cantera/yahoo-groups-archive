At least, it WILL have the new \nformat as soon as version 1.5 is released, which is a few days away for \nunix, a few more for Windows.\n\nBUT while you are waiting you can read all about it in a new document I \nhave written called &quot;Defining Phases and Interfaces&quot;. This not only \ndescribes the new format, but introduces some new parts of Cantera \nbriefly (surface chemistry, electrochemistry), and has a couple of \ncomplete examples. The document is available now on the SourceForge \nsite http://sourceforge.net/projects/cantera in &quot;Files/Cantera \nDocumentation/Input Files&quot;.\n\nI hope you will take a look at it, and if you have comments or \nsuggestions, please let me know.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
