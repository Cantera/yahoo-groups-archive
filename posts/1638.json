I then moved on to run a modified version of the  \n&gt; adiabatic_flame.py file for\n&gt; my particular case.  This is when I first received this error.  I  \n&gt; have executed the source\n&gt; command stated at the end of the install and verified that my PATH  \n&gt; has what I think is\n&gt; required:\n&gt;\n&gt; /Applications/Cantera/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ \n&gt; Versions/Current/\n&gt; bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/ \n&gt; graphviz-2.12/bin:/\n&gt; Applications:/usr/local:/Applications/MATLAB73/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/ \n&gt; bin:/usr/sbin\n&gt;\n&gt; I also tried several files in MATLAB (flame, flame1, ignite, and  \n&gt; others) and all had an error\n&gt; with gri30 and IdealGasMix.\n&gt;\n&gt; I imagine I&#39;ve missed something somewhere along the line, but I  \n&gt; don&#39;t know where.  It\n&gt; seems odd to me that it worked for several files then stopped.  In  \n&gt; perhaps a somewhat\n&gt; hasty response, I deleted the Cantera folder under Applications and  \n&gt; re-installed Cantera.  I\n&gt; continue to receive the same error.  Does anyone have any ideas on  \n&gt; how to remove this\n&gt; error?  Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rusty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
