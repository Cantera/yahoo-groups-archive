So you should certainly be using Matlab 7\nif you&#39;re going to use Cantera 1.6.0.\n\n2) You can use much of Cantera without python, but all of your thermo\ninput needs to come from .xml files (the conversion from .cti to .xml\nis the python-dependent step).  I think that the 1.6.0 installer comes\nwith a few input files already converted, but if not, I can send you a\nfew examples.  They should be in your C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Common\nFiles&#92;Cantera&#92;Data directory.  With a fresh install of 1.6.0, you\nshould be able to type:\n\n&gt;&gt; G = idealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;)\n\nat the matlab prompt and get things to work from there.  Note that the\ntutorials and demos will NOT work because they use the\nPython-dependent command:\n\n&gt;&gt; G = idealGasMix(&#39;gri30.cti&#39;)\n\n3) Python is very simple to install, and it&#39;s free, so don&#39;t be afraid\nto give that a try to get Cantera&#39;s full functionality.  There are a\ncouple of steps involved in setting the path correctly in your\noperating system, but they&#39;re pretty well documented in various\nversions of the Cantera installation instructions.\n\nGood Luck!\n\n-A.J.\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pesentib_fpms&quot; &lt;Barbara.Pesenti@f...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; I&#39;m a very new user of the Cantera user&#39;s Group but I currently use \n&gt; a very old version of the Matlab files series of Cantera (the\nzipped \n&gt; file was cantera-mlab-10.zip, downloaded in 2002).  I used it the \n&gt; last time with Matlab 6, one year ago...and it still worked \n&gt; properly.  I try to re-use it but I always get the following error \n&gt; message:\n&gt; \n&gt; Unable to load mex file: C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;Barbara \n&gt; Pesenti&#92;Mes documents&#92;Utils&#92;Utilitaires \n&gt; Pphys&#92;Cantera&#92;Cantera_Matlab&#92;cantera-mlab-10\n&gt; &#92;cantera&#92;@Phase&#92;private&#92;newphase.dll.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried to change the path, to move the files, to work in the \n&gt; directory where the files are,... but noting works.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone still use this old version somewhere and can advise me?\n \n&gt; \n&gt; If not, I&#39;d like to know how to use the latest release of Cantera\nin \n&gt; Matlab.  I have downloaded and installed the new toolbox in \n&gt; &#92;Cantera&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera, but it appearently needs Python to \n&gt; run inside Matlab.  Python was not necessary with the older version \n&gt; of the matlab routines and I am therefore a little bit confused\nwith \n&gt; the new release (I&#39;m really not familiar with Python).  Could you \n&gt; please tell me how I should proceed to make the latest Cantera \n&gt; Toolbox run into Matlab (6 or 7)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance to anyone who can help,\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Barbara\n\n\n\n"}}
