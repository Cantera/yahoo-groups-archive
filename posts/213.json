We are\n&gt; trying to develp a plug flow reactor model for catalytic (on Pt\n&gt; surface) partial methane oxidation, which can be expressed by :\n&gt; CH4+0.5O2=CO+2H2. I noticed that someone has already posted a\n&gt; message about PFR model and you mentioned that we can use dz=V(gas)\n&gt; *dt to convert the zero-dimentional model to a plug flow reactor.\n&gt; Here, I have several questions about the zero dimentional model\n&gt; surfreactor.m:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Is the kinetics also valid for the Partial Oxidation of Methane\n&gt; on Pt surface, or, where did u get the original kinetics of the Pt\n&gt; combustion?\n&gt;\nThe mechanism for catalytic combustion on Pt is published in\n\n     O. Deutschmann, R. Schmidt, F. Behrendt, J. Warnatz. Numerical  \nModeling of Catalytic Ignition. Proc. Combust. Inst. 26 (1996)  \n1747-1754.\n\nPlease consult this paper for more information about the mechanism.\n\n\n&gt; 2) In surfreactor.m, you wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; t = 870.0;\n&gt; gas = importPhase(&#39;ptcombust.cti&#39;,&#39;gas&#39;);\n&gt;\n&gt; % set the initial conditions\n&gt; set(gas,&#39;T&#39;,t,&#39;P&#39;,oneatm,&#39;X&#39;,&#39;CH4:0.02, O2:0.21, N2:0.784&#39;);\n&gt;\n&gt; surf = importInterface(&#39;ptcombust.cti&#39;,&#39;Pt_surf&#39;, gas);\n&gt; setTemperature(surf, t);\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this mean you set both the Pt wall surface and the inlet gas as\n&gt; the same temperature? If the answer is yes, why should we do like\n&gt; that, cause, I think the inlet gas might enter the reactor in a much\n&gt; lower temperature and be heated by the hotter wall until it reaches\n&gt; a considerable high temperature to ignite the reaction.\n&gt;\nThe state of the gas object is used to represent the initial conditions  \nwhen the Reactor object is created. Since this calculation is  \nzero-dimensional, no temperature gradients are resolved within the  \nreactor, and the reactor interior and the surface are kept at the same  \ntemperature.\n\n&gt; 3) You wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; setArea(w, 1.0e-4);\n&gt; setHeatTransferCoeff(w,0.1);\n&gt;\n&gt; I am just wondering how the parameters, like 1.0e-4 and 0.1 comes\n&gt; from? Cause in our system, we might have significant different\n&gt; values of the catalyst surface area as well as the heat transfer\n&gt; coefficient.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you very much for your time.\n&gt;\nYes, they might be very different. There were only for the example.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Tengfei\n&gt;\n&gt; Dept. of Chemical Engineering,\n&gt; University of Pittsburgh\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
