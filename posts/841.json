Can&#39;t you have sites \n&gt; Cu(S1), CH3O(S1), CU(S1a), H(S1a), etc. all as part of one surface \n&gt; phase?  If your reactions conserve site types (i.e. there are the same \n&gt; number of S1 reactants and products, S1a reactants and products, etc.) \n&gt; then I don&#39;t see the problem with this approach.  You can even enforce \n&gt; this by creating an &quot;element&quot; in the cti file for a site type and \n&gt; defining the species on that site type to contain this &quot;element&quot;. For \n&gt; example:\n&gt; \n&gt; element(name = &quot;S1_site&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; species(name = &quot;Cu(S1)&quot;,\n&gt;                 atoms  = &quot;Cu:1, S1_site:1&quot;,\n&gt;                 thermo = ... )\n&gt; \n&gt; If you do this, the reactions will be checked to confirm they balance \n&gt; &#39;element&#39;  &quot;S1_site&quot;.  Having said this, I don&#39;t think this works in \n&gt; released versions of Cantera, but should in the CVS prerelease version \n&gt; 1.6.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking of which, I&#39;m going to try to release the current version of \n&gt; Cantera this week.  I have been waiting to finish implementing some \n&gt; features I have said would be in 1.6, but that I have not had time to \n&gt; do yet.  But this is taking too long, and there are useful new \n&gt; capabilities in the latest unreleased code, even if not everything is \n&gt; finished, I will go ahead and do an intermediate release.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jun 6, 2005, at 2:53 PM, mollusk1954 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am trying to implement a methanol/Cu-ZnO surface reaction model\n&gt; &gt; where there are four different types of surface sites.  In the model\n&gt; &gt; methanol undergoes a dissociative adsorption with CH3O adsorption on\n&gt; &gt; one type of site and H adsorption on a different type of site.  I set\n&gt; &gt; up the problem using four different surface phases with all of their\n&gt; &gt; associated species.  In particular there is a surface I called\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Cu(S1)&quot; containing species CU(S1) and CH3O(S1) (among others) and a\n&gt; &gt; surface I called &quot;Cu(S1a)&quot; containing the species CU(S1a) and H(S1a).\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ct2ctml&quot; exits with an error on the reaction CU(S1) + CU(S1a) + CH3OH\n&gt; &gt; =&gt; CH3O(S1) + H(S1a) claiming &quot;A surface reaction may contain at most\n&gt; &gt; one surface phase.&quot;  Is there a work-around for this?  If there is I\n&gt; &gt; hope it isn&#39;t too cumbersome because I have 11 other reactions in the\n&gt; &gt; model with the same difficulty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for all help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dave Mikolaitis\n&gt; &gt; University of Florida\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
