I thought that you chan=\r\nged \nthermodynamic properties of some components such as a heat of formatio=\r\nn \netc. But now I don&#39;t understand why do you use the Reactors Network to \n=\r\nsimulate heat losses in a piston. You can do it very easy with one \nreactor=\r\n, changing the heat transfer coefficient. Even you can introduce \nan arbitr=\r\nary time-dependent function for heat losses. \n\nBest regards, Anatoli  \n\n\n\n"}}
