I put the command &#39;source setup_cantera&#39; in my \nlogin script.\n\n&#39;ctnew&#39; is a script that generates a demo c++ program and a Makefile to \nbuild it, with the paths in the Makefile set up with the appropriate \npath names for your installation of Cantera.\nAll it really does is copy some files from the Cantera &#39;templates&#39; \ndirectory to your current working directory.  Type &#39;ctnew -cxx&#39; to \ngenerate a C++ demo, and &#39;ctnew -f90&#39; to generate a Fortran 90 demo.  \nBoth show how to do some of the most common operations, such as \ndefining a reacting gas mixture, setting its state, computing chemical \nequilibrium, and computing its thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport \nproperties.  For application programs that only require these features \nof Cantera, these demos provide a good starting point to write your own \ncode.  At least that&#39;s the idea.\n\n\n\nOn Dec 21, 2004, at 12:54 PM, hpeterjoo wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (My friend is helping me on his linux machine).\n&gt;\n&gt; Everything has been compiled from CVS and installed.
