I think it is a good fit to my\nproblem, but I&#39;d like=\r\n the opinion of other more experienced\nusers before I dive fully in.\n\nI&#39;m t=\r\nhinking of using cantera as &quot;chemistry engine&quot; for a\nCFD code I&#39;m developin=\r\ng. I&#39;m mostly interested, at this time, on\nphase equilibrium, but I&#39;m *very=\r\n* interested on adding chemical\nreactions later on.\n\nI intend to write most=\r\nly in python, with numpy (numarray\nto stay compatible with cantera) using f=\r\ninite differences.\nThe domains (and the number of cells) can be really big.=\r\n\n\nWould you think cantera is appropriate for this?\nIf this does not sound t=\r\noo absurd, I have another question.\n\nI haven&#39;t really looked at cantera&#39;s c=\r\node yet, but I&#39;m already\nthinking how to adapt it to a CFD code.\n\nThe fist =\r\nand obvious way is to work with arrays of Cantera\nphases, ie, to store in e=\r\nach (of the many many thousands) cell\na cantera phase, and use it&#39;s own int=\r\nernal variables on each cell\nto keep track of molar fractions, etc. This wo=\r\nuld be _very_ neat,\nbut I&#39;m afraid there could be too much overhead, since =\r\na lot of\nthe information would be replicated on all cells.\n\nThe other would=\r\n be to store everything myself, and just invoke\ncantera passing the full th=\r\nermodynamical state to it. This looks kind\nof gross, considering I&#39;d be was=\r\nting a lot of the good thinking and\nhard work Dr. Goodwin already applied t=\r\no this problem! In the end I&#39;d\nend up replicating most of the phases and fl=\r\nuid classes (which I\nalready had started to do, before I decided to check t=\r\nhe internet,\njust in case someone had had the same problem before, and here=\r\n I am).\n\nSorry for the long post, any comments or suggestions most welcome.=\r\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nRamiro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
