I suspect this problem is occurring in  \nthe evaluation of collision integrals. These are evaluated by  \npolynomial interpolation from tables published by Monchick and Mason.   \nProbably the non-dimensional temperature T* is going out of range. Or  \nelse there is a problem with delta* for H2O, if you are including water  \nin your mixture.  The log file transport_log.xml might contain some  \nclues.\n\nI should probably add a transport option to skip the usual formulas and  \njust interpolatae from user-input data values.\n\nDave\n\nOn Nov 11, 2003, at 1:09 PM, kdpatch wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi--\n&gt;\n&gt; I need to extend the thermophysical properties of several gases in\n&gt; CANTERA to lower temperatures.  For example, hydrogen (H2) currently\n&gt; seems to have a lower limit of 200 K, I need to extend it down to\n&gt; cryogenic temperatures (~20 K).\n&gt;\n&gt; I am getting new polynomial fits to the JANAF data using the &quot;old&quot; 7-\n&gt; term polynomial form for my various gases.  This will satisfy my\n&gt; thermodynamic data source requirements.\n&gt;\n&gt; For transport properties (viscosity & thermal conductivity), I do\n&gt; not have a complete listing of the various calculational forms used\n&gt; in CANTERA.  If I did, I would be able to fit low-temperature\n&gt; literature data and extract the best &quot;diam&quot; and &quot;well_depth&quot;\n&gt; coefficients.\n&gt;\n&gt; As an alternative, I was going to use MATLAB to do a least-squares\n&gt; fit to literature data, and determine the best diam and well_depth\n&gt; coefficients without needing to know the exact form of the viscosity\n&gt; & thermal conductivity calculations.  However, as I was trying to\n&gt; find a starting point for this procedure, I was manually varying\n&gt; CANTERA&#39;s diam and well_depth coefficients, and found that I cannot\n&gt; get a viscosity for temperatures below 60K, and I cannot get a\n&gt; thermal conductivity below 100 K!  This is regardless of how small I\n&gt; make diam, and regardless of how large I make well_depth.\n&gt;\n&gt; The error message I get for H2 viscosity below 60 K is (diam = 0.1\n&gt; and well_depth = 2, vs the default of diam = 2.92 and well_depth =\n&gt; 38.):\n&gt;\n&gt; ===begin===\n&gt;\n&gt; ??? &lt;no Cantera error&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&gt; &#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;ctmethods.dll\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&gt; &#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;private&#92;trans_get.m\n&gt; On line 5  ==&gt;   v = ctmethods(50, n, job);\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&gt; &#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;viscosity.m\n&gt; On line 2  ==&gt; v = trans_get(a.id, 1);\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ====end====\n&gt;\n&gt; The error message I get for thermal conductivity below 100 K is:\n&gt;\n&gt; ===begin===\n&gt;\n&gt; ??? &lt;no Cantera error&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&gt; &#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;ctmethods.dll\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&gt; &#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;private&#92;trans_get.m\n&gt; On line 5  ==&gt;   v = ctmethods(50, n, job);\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; c:&#92;program files&#92;cantera15\n&gt; &#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Transport&#92;thermalConductivity.m\n&gt; On line 3  ==&gt; v = trans_get(a.id, 2);\n&gt;\n&gt; ====end====\n&gt;\n&gt; My questions are:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.  Re: my errors below 60 or 100 K, is there a built-in lower limit\n&gt; in CANTERA&#39;s transport properties that has to be removed?  Or some\n&gt; other way I can force it to go down to ~20 K?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.  Are CANTERA&#39;s calculational methods for viscosity & thermal\n&gt; conductivity (both pure components & mixtures) detailed in a\n&gt; reference? (Is it &quot;Marerro and Mason, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, vol.\n&gt; 1, p. 3 (1972)&quot; [in TransportFactory.cpp] for pure components; and\n&gt; is it &quot;Dixon-Lewis (1968) and Kee, Coltrin, and Glarborg (2002)&quot; [in\n&gt; tut6.m] for multicomponent or mixture-averaged models?)  I&#39;ve\n&gt; started looking at CANTERA&#39;s source code . . . found the collision\n&gt; integrals . . . and I hope that a summary might be available, to\n&gt; insure that I get it right.\n&gt;\n&gt; TIA,\n&gt;\n&gt; --Keith\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
