Can&#39;t you have sites \nCu(S1), CH3O(S1), CU(S1a), H(S1a), etc. all as part of one surface \nphase?  If your reactions conserve site types (i.e. there are the same \nnumber of S1 reactants and products, S1a reactants and products, etc.) \nthen I don&#39;t see the problem with this approach.  You can even enforce \nthis by creating an &quot;element&quot; in the cti file for a site type and \ndefining the species on that site type to contain this &quot;element&quot;. For \nexample:\n\nelement(name = &quot;S1_site&quot;)\n\nspecies(name = &quot;Cu(S1)&quot;,\n                atoms  = &quot;Cu:1, S1_site:1&quot;,\n                thermo = ... )\n\nIf you do this, the reactions will be checked to confirm they balance \n&#39;element&#39;  &quot;S1_site&quot;.  Having said this, I don&#39;t think this works in \nreleased versions of Cantera, but should in the CVS prerelease version \n1.6.\n\nSpeaking of which, I&#39;m going to try to release the current version of \nCantera this week.  I have been waiting to finish implementing some \nfeatures I have said would be in 1.6, but that I have not had time to \ndo yet.  But this is taking too long, and there are useful new \ncapabilities in the latest unreleased code, even if not everything is \nfinished, I will go ahead and do an intermediate release.\n\nDave\n\nOn Jun 6, 2005, at 2:53 PM, mollusk1954 wrote:\n\n&gt; I am trying to implement a methanol/Cu-ZnO surface reaction model\n&gt; where there are four different types of surface sites.  In the model\n&gt; methanol undergoes a dissociative adsorption with CH3O adsorption on\n&gt; one type of site and H adsorption on a different type of site.  I set\n&gt; up the problem using four different surface phases with all of their\n&gt; associated species.  In particular there is a surface I called\n&gt; &quot;Cu(S1)&quot; containing species CU(S1) and CH3O(S1) (among others) and a\n&gt; surface I called &quot;Cu(S1a)&quot; containing the species CU(S1a) and H(S1a).\n&gt; &quot;ct2ctml&quot; exits with an error on the reaction CU(S1) + CU(S1a) + CH3OH\n&gt; =&gt; CH3O(S1) + H(S1a) claiming &quot;A surface reaction may contain at most\n&gt; one surface phase.&quot;  Is there a work-around for this?  If there is I\n&gt; hope it isn&#39;t too cumbersome because I have 11 other reactions in the\n&gt; model with the same difficulty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for all help.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave Mikolaitis\n&gt; University of Florida\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
