I resolved to keep using\nMatlab/Cantera, exce=\r\npt for multiphase equilibria, since the function\n&quot;mixture&quot; works well in py=\r\nthon but fails in matlab. Well, apart for\nthat, I find that the actual vers=\r\nion of Cantera covers all the\nheterogeneous catalytic applications, where o=\r\nne writes his own reactor\nmodels.\nDaniela \n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;Dave Goodwin&quot; &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Is anyone in the group experience=\r\nd in writing MATLAB MEX C/Matlab\ninterface code? If so, \n&gt; and if you are i=\r\nnterested in putting in a lot of work for free...\nsee me about being the \n&gt;=\r\n maintainer of the Cantera MATLAB toolbox.  I personally don&#39;t use\nMATLAB, =\r\nsince I find that \n&gt; Python can do just about everything MATLAB can do, whe=\r\nn supplemented\nby packages like \n&gt; &quot;scipy&quot;, &quot;matplotlib&quot; etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt; So tho=\r\nse of you who are MATLAB / Cantera users should talk among\nyourselves, nomi=\r\nnate \n&gt; someone to keep the MATLAB toolbox up to date, and then convince\nhi=\r\nm/her to do it...\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
