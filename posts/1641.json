I would like to know if it is possible to\nbuild movies in order to see the evolution of the\noxidation process as function of time. \nThe problem is that when I postprocess the output\nfiles the reaction path diagram structures appear\ndifferent as function of the time, reactions and\nspecies involved during the evolution of the process,\nthus it is not possible to see the same structure in\nall the files processed by means of Graphviz.\nTherefore I can not build movies.\nIs there someone that can give me some suggestions to\nsolve this problem? \n\n\n      ___________________________________ \nL&#39;email della prossima generazione?
