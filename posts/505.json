No Fortran compiler is \n&gt; required.  They are currently available only via anonymous CVS.  To get \n&gt; them, you first need to check out the Cantera source distribution using \n&gt; anonymous CVS, and then go into the top-level Cantera directory and \n&gt; delete the entire &#39;win32&#39; directory.  Then from this top-level \n&gt; directory type at a command prompt &#39;cvs co win32&#39; to check out the new \n&gt; win32 module, which will replace the old win32 directory.  See the \n&gt; README file in this directory for complete instructions on how to build \n&gt; Cantera with Visual C++ .NET.\n\nI just tried to compile with this, following the directions in the \nrelevant README file, and had a few problems.\n\nFirst, when trying to build cantera.sln, I was unable to build \n&quot;cvode&quot; because it couldn&#39;t find the header files.  Copying the \nheader files into the directory with the cvode source files seems to \nwork as a workaround, but I presume there&#39;s some path munged up that \ncan be easily fixed.\n\nMore significantly, I can&#39;t get the makefiles to work right; they \nkeep exiting with errors.  Specifically, on the &quot;make win&quot; command:\n\n==============================================================\nBROOKS-GCEP:~/Projects/Cantera_Source/cantera&gt; make win\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera\nrm -r -f build/include/cantera/*\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/oneD\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/zeroD\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/converters\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/transport\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/cxx/include/*.h build/include/cantera\n/usr/bin/install -c config.h build/include/cantera\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/*.h build/include/cantera/kernel\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/oneD/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/oneD\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/zeroD/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/zeroD\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/converters/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/converters\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/transport/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/transport\ncd Cantera/python; make win\nmake[1]: Entering directory \n`/brooks/Projects/Cantera_Source/cantera/Cantera/python&#39;\ntouch src/pycantera.cpp\n(c:/python23/python.exe setup.py build)\nrunning build\nrunning build_py\nrunning build_ext\nerror: Python was built with version 6 of Visual Studio, and \nextensions need to be built with the same version of the compiler, \nbut it isn&#39;t installed.\nmake[1]: *** [_winbuild] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory \n`/brooks/Projects/Cantera_Source/cantera/Cantera/python&#39;\nmake: *** [python] Error 2\n==============================================================\n\n\nIf I take out the makefile command relating to the python stuff, then \nall the rest seems to run, but when I eventually get done with the \n&quot;make win-install&quot; command (which I also had to take a python-stuff \ncommand out of), and try to run the cxx-examples.exe file, I get all \nsorts of errors about &quot;ctml-write module not found&quot;.\n\nIs there a way to resolve this, or do I need to get the Python source \nand recompile it myself?  (And is doing this the family-sized can of \nworms that I fear it will be?)\n\nAnd, while I&#39;m asking: does this mean that those examples are \ndepending on Python to run, despite being part of the cxx example \nset?  Does this imply that all C++ cantera programs will need Python?\n\nAlso, some smaller questions related to the installation: the \n&quot;cantera&quot; solution builds a clib.dll file, but it doesn&#39;t actually \nseem to get put anywhere by the installation process.  What is \nsupposed to happen with that?  And the cxx-examples.exe and similar \nexample stuff; is that supposed to get put somewhere in the installed \ndirectory?\n\n\n(And, as a final note: it might be useful to somewhere note that the \nMatlab compiler is needed to compile the Matlab interface.  Although \nperhaps that&#39;s obvious to people who, unlike me, know the first thing \nabout making Matlab interfaces!)\n\nThanks,\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n"}}
