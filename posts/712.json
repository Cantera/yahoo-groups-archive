I get an error \nhowever when I try to open the &#39;Reaction Paths...&#39; window, see text \nfrom the cmd prompt below. When the Reaction Paths window opens it is \nblank, it seems that &#39;rxnpath.gif&#39; is not recognized.\n  Have others had this problem? I saw no similar posts, except 662 \nwhich had a different MixMaster problem. I do not look forward to \nreinstalling everything as all the other functions seem to work (I am \nusing the Matlab interface). Thoughts are welcome,\n- Carl\n\n\nException in Tkinter callback\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;lib&#92;lib-tk&#92;Tkinter.py&quot;, line 1345, in __call__\n    return self.func(*args)\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;Lib&#92;site-packages&#92;MixMaster&#92;main.py&quot;, line 300, \nin showrpath\ns\n    self._windows[&#39;rxnpaths&#39;].show()\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;Lib&#92;site-packages&#92;MixMaster&#92;KineticsFrame.py&quot;, \nline 349, in\nshow\n    self.rp = PhotoImage(file=&#39;rxnpath.gif&#39;)\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;lib&#92;lib-tk&#92;Tkinter.py&quot;, line 3202, in __init__\n    Image.__init__(self, &#39;photo&#39;, name, cnf, master, **kw)\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;lib&#92;lib-tk&#92;Tkinter.py&quot;, line 3158, in __init__\n    self.tk.call((&#39;image&#39;, &#39;create&#39;, imgtype, name,) + options)\nTclError: couldn&#39;t recognize data in image file &quot;rxnpath.gif&quot;\nwarning, language gif not recognized, use one of:\n dot canon plain plain-ext\nwarning, language gif not recognized, use one of:\n dot canon plain plain-ext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
