I use Cantera in\n&gt; Matlab (version 7, Release 14).  It appears that the &#39;display.m&#39; file\n&gt; was omitted from the ...&#92;cantera&#92;@Solution directory.  Currently, when\n&gt; a Gas Object is called in Matlab, I only see the:\n&gt;\n&gt; G =\n&gt;\n&gt; \tSolution object: 1-by-1\n&gt;\n&gt; message.  I added the old (v1.5.4, I think) &#39;display.m&#39; file to the\n&gt; appropriate folder, and the old &quot;solution display&quot; functionality is\n&gt; restored.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see that in your new Tutorial file, the display functionality is\n&gt; updated with enthalpy, entropy, etc. values.  It would be great to\n&gt; have this in the new v1.6.0, but in the meantime, I figured I&#39;d let\n&gt; you know that this file is missing so that you can add either the old\n&gt; one, or hopefully the new one to the .msi installer.  Also, it appears\n&gt; that the &#39;clear.m&#39; file is missing from that folder as well, although\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how critical it is to use Cantera&#39;s clear as opposed to\n&gt; Matlab&#39;s internal clear function.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m going to continue to play around with 1.6.0, and I&#39;ll let you know\n&gt; if I come across anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -A.J.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
