Our code for this worked in \nCantera 1.4, but now that I&#39;ve updated to Cantera 1.5.5, it&#39;s stopped \nworking due to an inability of Cantera to achieve convergence.  The \nfollowing test case illustrates the problem:\n\n gas0 = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;);\n X = &#39;N2:0.76,O2:0.20,H2O:0.025,CO2:0.000375,AR:0.01&#39;;\n setMassFractions(gas0,X);\n set(gas0,&#39;T&#39;,300,&#39;P&#39;,101325);\n equilibrate(gas0, &#39;TP&#39;);\n\nRunning this, on my systems, produces a &quot;no convergence in 1000 \niterations&quot; error.  The convergence failure is repeatable over a \nfairly wide range of adjustments to the gas concentrations; it\nappears \nthat it will result from any mixture that consists of O2, H2O, and \nCO2.\n\n(Given that this testcase is reduced from code that worked with \nCantera 1.4, I presume that it also would have worked, but I can&#39;t \ntest it.)\n\nIn addition, if I preceed the equilbration at constant TP with an \nequilibration at constant TV, the TV equilibration works fine, but\nthe \nequilibration at constant TP still fails despite being given a \npre-equilibrated mixture.\n\nI should also note that I suspect this may be a programming bug\nrather \nthan an algorithm bug, as on about 10 percent of the runs I get \n&quot;segmentation violation&quot; errors in clib.dll, rather than a &quot;number of \niterations exceeded&quot; error -- though this doesn&#39;t seem to be \nrepeatable; the 10-percent number is based on 50 repeats of the exact \nsame m-file.\n\nDoes a fix exist for this yet?\n\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n\n"}}
