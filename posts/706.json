The MATLAB object only contains a pointer (actually an \ninteger) to a C++ object.  So this statement creates a copy of the \npointer, with the result that both gas1 and gas2 point to the same C++ \nobject.  To create two independent gases, you need to call IdealGsMix \ntwice:\n\ngas1 = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;);\ngas2 = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;);\n\n\nOn Feb 11, 2005, at 12:03 PM, Josh Freeh wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone -\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to track two gases (of type Solution) in a Matlab file.\n&gt; When I modify one of the gases, the other changes as well. I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure if it&#39;s something with Matlab&#39;s variable handling or\n&gt; something with the Cantera code itself. I plan on trying to\n&gt; duplicate this in either Python or C++  to investigate whether it\n&gt; is something in Cantera.
