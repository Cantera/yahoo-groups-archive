But s=\r\nome of them\n&gt; indicate that the problem was resolved in version 1.7.1.  Whe=\r\nre can I\n&gt; find that version (I looked briefly at the CVS and did not see\n&gt;=\r\n anything newer than 1.7, except for Makefile.in)?\n&gt; \n&gt; (I am not super-com=\r\nfortable modifying the makefiles, but with clear\n&gt; enough instructions I am=\r\n willing to do it).\n&gt; \n&gt; In case it is of relevance, I think I have 64-bit =\r\npython, simply\n&gt; because my python2.4 sits in the /usr/lib64 directory.  (I=\r\nt came\n&gt; pre-installed)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mirko\n&gt;\n\nI looked at=\r\n the preconfig script, and of course, the PIC flag is\nalready set there.
