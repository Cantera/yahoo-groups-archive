I have installed the \nMATLAB tool=\r\ns and everything is working fine. I have read the tutorials, \nand still is =\r\nnot clear to me how to obtain the derivatives of the \nthermodynamic propert=\r\nies of the gas mixture. In particular, I am \ninterested in calculating the =\r\nderivatives respect to pressure and \ntemperature of the internal energies: =\r\ndu/dp, du/dT. Is this doable in \nCantera? Thank you very much for your kind=\r\n attention.\n\nBest Regards,\nPeter \n\n\n"}}
