See the \nattached Python script and Powerpoint file with results.  This script \nsimulates 5 coupled reactors in a line, with the left-most reactor wall \nmoving with a prescribed Gaussian velocity (relative to fixed lab \ncoordinates), and the other 4 walls moving in response to pressure \ndifferences.  The response of the wall to pressure differences is \nintentionally set to a small value, for a more interesting solution.  \nSetting K larger keeps all reactors at the same pressure.

If you\n&gt; want to run your simulation in Python, all you need =\r\nto do is this:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Create 2 reactors that share a common wall (A), and m=\r\nake it\n&gt; flexible\n&gt; enough to maintain pressure equilibrium.\n&gt; 2) Add a sec=\r\nond wall (B) to reactor 2 with a specified vdot rate vs.\n&gt; time. This will =\r\nactually change the total volume, not just volume 2,\n&gt; with time, since the=\r\n rate of volume change for each reactor is\n&gt; computed\n&gt; by summing over all=\r\n of its walls. Thus, the rate of change of volume\n&gt; of\n&gt; reactor 1 plus rea=\r\nctor 2 equals the specified vdot for wall B:\n&gt; dV/dt_1\n&gt; + dV/dt_2 =3D vdot=\r\n(A) + (vdot(B) - vdot(A)) =3D vdot(B).\n&gt;\n&gt; The only reason this can&#39;t be do=\r\nne from Matlab too is that I haven&#39;t\n&gt; gotten around to adding the necessar=\r\ny interfacing code to the Matlab\n&gt; toolbox.
