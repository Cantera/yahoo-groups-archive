I am very\n&gt; familliar with c/c++ and I like the approach that you are using with\n&gt; cantera.  I have been trying to setup a kinetics problem utilizing a\n&gt; Valve object.  Is there something about its implementation that\n&gt; requires something different that MassFlowController objects?  I can\n&gt; use these but get a segmentation violation whenever I use a Valve.\n&gt; I have checked your documentation but cannot seem to find any\n&gt; information that is of help with this subject.\n&gt;\n&gt; Darin S.
