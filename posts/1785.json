But since it  \nusually not the latest version, many people install their own Python  \n(for example, MacPython, which comes with many extras not in the  \nsystem Python, including the IDLE editor.  You need to make sure that  \nyou install Cantera for the particular Python interpreter you later  \nwant to use Cantera with.  The system Python from Apple and MacPython  \nstore their files in completely different places.  In particular,  \nthey do not share the same &quot;site-packages&quot; directory, so packages  \ninstalled for one won&#39;t be seen by the other one.\n\nMy recommendation is to not mess with the system Python in /usr/bin.   \nThe OS uses this for various tasks, and it is best to leave it  \nalone.  So install MacPython or some other version for your use with  \nCantera.  All you have to do to tell Cantera which one to use is to  \ndefine environment variable PYTHON_CMD to point to the desired Python  \ninterpreter.  For example, if your Python interpreter is in /usr/ \nlocal/bin, then you would set this as follows:\n\nPYTHON_CMD=/usr/local/bin/python\nexport PYTHON_CMD\n\nThis syntax is for the &quot;sh&quot; shell; if you are using csh, then the  \nsyntax is a bit different.   You can define this in the preconfig  \nscript, and then it will be added to your &quot;setup_cantera&quot; script.  If  \nyou then add the line &quot;source setup_cantera&quot; to your shell  \ninitialization script (for example, .bashrc), then this will happen  \nautomatically and you won&#39;t have to think about it anymore...\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Dec 7, 2007, at 7:52 AM, d_puechberty wrote:\n\n&gt; I have some problem to install Cantera ( runnig with Python) on my  \n&gt; Mac book Pro\n&gt;\n&gt; After installing Python and Cantera in the folder Application i try  \n&gt; to use one of a demo\n&gt; example.\n&gt;\n&gt;  When I execute run command ( iddle)\n&gt;\n&gt; the error code is :\n&gt; Python 2.5 (r25:51918, Sep 19 2006, 08:49:13)\n&gt; [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5341)] on darwin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; IDLE 1.2\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ================================ RESTART\n&gt; ================================\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Traceback (most recent call last):\n&gt;   File &quot;/Applications/Cantera/demos/python/equilibrium/ \n&gt; adiabatic.py&quot;, line 7, in\n&gt; &lt;module&gt;\n&gt;     from Cantera import *\n&gt; ImportError: No module named Cantera\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Can somebody help ant tell me what I have to do for running cantera  \n&gt; on my Mac\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely yours\n&gt;\n&gt; PS I don&#39;t find any comments on the documentation web site which  \n&gt; can help me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
