However, I am now trying to simulate the combustion process\nwith a s=\r\neries of adiabatic reactors because I need to do some\noperations on the the=\r\nrmodynamic properties between two timestps. At\nthe end of every timestep I =\r\nsave variables like gas temperature,\npressure and composition and, after do=\r\ning what I need to do, I\nre-initialize a new reactor with the initial condi=\r\ntions which I&#39;ve\ncomputed. Doing it I&#39;ve encountered a big problem: the rea=\r\nctor afeter\nthe first timesetp doesn&#39;t evaluate the chemestry in it. In oth=\r\ner\nwords it modifies the composition of the mixture only in the first\ntimes=\r\ntep, during the others it doesn&#39;t do anything regarding the\nreactions in it=\r\n so I cannot evaluate the correct behavior of the gas\nduring the compressio=\r\nn and expansion strokes.\nSomebody has ideas or suggestions about it?\nThank =\r\nyou very much for your help and your willingness.\n\nDaniele\n\n\n"}}
