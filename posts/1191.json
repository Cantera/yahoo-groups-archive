I am going down this route to decrease our reliance on \nChemkin, specifi=\r\ncally the Aurora code in Chemkin. \n\nSo my question, does anyone know where =\r\nto find, or have any MATLAB \nreactor code for a constant temperature and pr=\r\nessure situation? Any \nhelp or suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nThanks, E=\r\nric \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
