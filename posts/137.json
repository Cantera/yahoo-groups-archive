There is now some documentation for the Cantera Python interface.  \nGo to the main Cantera page (http://www.python.org), then follow the \nlink &#39;Documentation&#39; to &#39;Documented Python Code&#39;\nIt is still a work in progress, but provides a reference for the \nvarious methods available ini each class.\n\n2.  This is really a preannouncement --- 1D flames are coming to \nMATLAB!  I will release an update next week that will allow doing 1D \nflames in MATLAB, including stagnation-point flames, and hopefully \nfreely-propagating and opposed-jet flames (premixed or not).  Should be \navailable by next Wednesday or so; maybe sooner.  Stay tuned...\n\ndg\n\n\n\n"}}
