I \nneed compute the transport properties of a gas mixture. I run the file \ntransport1.m in the MATLAB/demos and it works fine. But when I run my \nown M file in which function equilibrate is used, I got different kind \nof error messages. Sometimes, it runs and gives me a reasonable result, \nsometimes, it runs and gives Nan for all transport properties, sometimes\nit does not run and gives error message such as &#39;segmentation error&#39;. \nNote that the code itself is the same. I just try run different times. \nIt gives me different things. I guess it is related to memory. Any help \nto fix this will be highly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nxiaoyen wang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
