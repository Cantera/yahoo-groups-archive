For 1step-reaction CH4 + 2 O2 =3D=\r\n&gt;\nCO2 + 2 H2O is sufficient to modifie the orders of the reaction in the\n.c=\r\nti file. Now, i&#39;m trying to perform a 1D premixed flame with a 2step\nreacti=\r\non:\n1) CH4 +1.5 02 =3D&gt; CO +2 H2O, Arrhenius parameters=3D[0.6000E+16, 0.0,=\r\n\n35000], order=3D&quot;CH4:0.9 O2:1.10 &quot;\n2) CO + 0.5 O2 &lt;=3D&gt; CO2, Arrhenius par=\r\nametr=3D[0.2E+10, 0.0, 12000].\nIn this case it is not sufficent to change t=\r\nhe order of the reaction\nto achieve some good results. Actually, the method=\r\n is convergent but,\neven if the adiabatic temperature and the mole fraction=\r\ns of the\nspecies are correct, the speed flame is completly wrong. I can&#39;t f=\r\nind\nwhere is the problem. I hope to have benn sufficiently clear. \nThanks f=\r\nor any helps\nBenedetta \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;benedetta.fr=\r\nanzelli&quot;\n&lt;benedetta.franzelli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi..I would like to use Cante=\r\nra to study air_Methane combustion with 1\n&gt; step mechanisme; i.e.    CH4 + =\r\n2 O2 =3D&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O .\n&gt; The progress rate Q is: Q =3D Kf  Prod_{k=3D1}^{N=\r\n} | X k | ^nk&#39;\n&gt; - Kr  Prod_{k=3D1}^{N} | X k | ^nk&#39;&#39;\n&gt; where Kf e Kr are t=\r\nhe forward and reverse rates of reaction, n is the\n&gt; number of species, | X=\r\n k | are the molar concentrations.
