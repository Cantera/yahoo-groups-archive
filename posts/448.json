The manual\n&gt; (f77.pdf) suggests:\n&gt;\n&gt; call newIdealGasMix(&#39;chem.inp&#39;,&#39;therm.dat&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; but that causes memory protection fault and crashes the code. I\n&gt; figured out that the third parameter is necessary, and i guessed\n&gt; somethinhg like:\n&gt;\n&gt; call newIdealGasMix(&#39;chem.inp&#39;, &#39;therm.dat&#39;, &#39;&#39;), or\n&gt; call newIdealGasMix(&#39;chem.inp&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;therm.dat&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; but in either case ctml writer finds an error:\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;    Traceback (most recent call last):\n&gt;      File &quot;C:&#92;Zoran&#92;Chemkin II&#92;other&#92;cantera_premix&#92;.cttmp.py&quot;, line\n&gt; 7, in ?\n&gt;        execfile(file)\n&gt;      File &quot;./chem.inp&quot;, line 2\n&gt;        H\n&gt;        ^\n&gt;    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; That is the first element, the line below the keyword ELEMENTS in\n&gt; chem.inp. The ck2cti accepts that chem.inp just fine, so I must be\n&gt; specifying arguments for newIdealGasMix() incorrectly...\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone knows what am I doing wrong here, the response would be\n&gt; much appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, if you want to use xml-translated kinetics, it appears\n&gt; that the model import function needs again one argument more than in\n&gt; the f77.pdf suggests, likely the model ID you specified when ck2cti\n&gt; was run.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;            Zoran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
