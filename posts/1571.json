The error\nwas in set=\r\nting the environmental variable Path.  The demos would not\nrun when I added=\r\n &quot;C:&#92;Python25&#92;Python.exe&quot; to the path, but would/will\nrun when I added &quot;C:&#92;=\r\nPython25&quot; to the path.  \n\nI&#39;m not sure if this is because my processor is a=\r\nn AMD Turion64x2, but\nI highly doubt it.  I&#39;m using Windows XP, Python25, n=\r\numarray-1.5.2,\nand Cantera 1.7.1. \n\nAfterwards however, it took a lot longe=\r\nr to run the Python demo,\n&#39;adiabatic&#39;, than it too to run the Matlab demo, =\r\n&#39;equil&#39;.  This is my\nfirst time using Python, let alone in conjunction with=\r\n Cantera, so I&#39;m\nnot sure if this is normal.  I&#39;ve only ever used SCT-Cante=\r\nra with\nMatlab (for the past three years).\n\nIf this has occurred with other=\r\n people, I would suggest updating the\nWiki install page - it took me a coup=\r\nle hours to figure out what was\ngoing on.  \n \n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; To simplify installing Cantera,=\r\n I have created a page on the Cantera  \n&gt; wiki that contains links to curre=\r\nnt versions of all installers (3)  \n&gt; needed to do a binary install of Cant=\r\nera on a PC.  All you need to to  \n&gt; is select each link, run the installer=\r\n, and do some minor  \n&gt; configuration (also described on this page).  Start=\r\ning from scratch,  \n&gt; it should be possible to install a working Cantera in=\r\nstallation from  \n&gt; this page in just a few minutes.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.canter=\r\na.org/wiki/index.php/Installers_for_Windows\n&gt; \n&gt; The links on this page wil=\r\nl be updated as versions change, so that it  \n&gt; will always download packag=\r\nes compatible with the latest version of  \n&gt; Cantera.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similar pages fo=\r\nr Mac and linux are coming soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
