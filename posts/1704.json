Therefore I start calcul=\r\nating\nthe demo files in the folder &quot;flames&quot;.\n\nNow I need some help for the =\r\nfollowing questions:\n\n1. In demo &quot;flame2&quot; for python GRI30 is chosen to def=\r\nine gas. What is\nGRI30 in detail and which alternatives can I choose at thi=\r\ns point?\n\n2. How can I get the chemical equations used in &quot;flame2&quot; for\ncomb=\r\nustion of methan/air (and in cantera in general)?\n\n3. As a result &quot;flame2&quot; =\r\nwrites data of four variables to a file. At\nwhich point these four variable=\r\ns are previosly defined? Can I define\nand add aditional variables for savin=\r\ng?\n\n4. Are there tools for cantera to determine further reaction\nquantities=\r\n like speed of reation?\n\n\nAnd a last question concerning the program enviro=\r\nnment:\n\nDid anybody try the free-ware tool octave instead of commercial MAT=\r\nLAB\nfor embedding cantera?\n\nThanks a lot for your support!\n\nrico\n\n\n"}}
