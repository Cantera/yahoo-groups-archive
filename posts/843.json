I read more detailed comments in\nReactor.h file, and now I&#39;m wondering in the 1-dimensional flame\nexamples (stflame1.py, npflame1.py) what is done to integrate chemical\nsource terms for 1-d similarity equations.  Do you use the same\nlarge-volume strategy or is there any derived class from Reactor class\nthat models constant-pressure process?  I tried to find a clue in\nStagnationFlow.py and onedim.py, but could tell what exactly is done\nin the code.  Thank you very much in advance,\nKazuo Sone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
