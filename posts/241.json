The first  \none, &#39;gri30&#39;, does not contain a transport model.  It is for use in  \nkinetics simulations which don&#39;t require transport properties.  The  \nsecond one &#39;gri30_mix&#39; supplies mixture-averaged transport properties,  \nand the third one &#39;gri30_multi&#39; supplies multicomponent transport  \nproperties.  To create an object using any entry but the first one in  \nthe file, you need to call IdealGasMix like this:\n\ngas = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.cti&#39;,&#39;gri30_mix&#39;);\n\nThe documentation for IdealGasMix.m is out of date and does not  \ncorrectly describe this. Also, note that in the released version of  \nCantera, flame simulations can only be done with mixture-averaged  \nproperties.  Using multicomponent properties in flame simulations will  \nbe possible in the next release, which should be out in a week or so.\n\nDave\n]\n\n\nOn Nov 17, 2003, at 11:06 AM, scheskis wrote:\n\n&gt; I tried to use  flame1.m demo (with matlab) for calculations with\n&gt; GRI3.0 mechanism.
