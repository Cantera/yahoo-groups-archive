However, the\ntemperature of the entering=\r\n species in known. It would be of great\nhelp to me, if anyone an suggest me=\r\n a method to do this.Moreover, can\ni calculate blow-off conditions in cante=\r\nra?\nI am using cantera with matlab.I was not able to find any examples on\np=\r\nlug flow reactor, or even an object of that kind.\n\ni would be grateful, if =\r\nmy problems are solved.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDeep Gupta\n\n\n"}}
