Indeed, for a free \n&gt; hydrogen/air flame Cantera calculates temperatures substantially \n&gt; lower than adiabatic ones (difference can be 40 K for a coarse grid). \n&gt; It happens when multicomponent transport is used. For a mixture-\n&gt; averaged model calculations are fine. Refining grid helps a little \n&gt; bit - difference decreases down to 20 K when number of grid points \n&gt; approaches 300. Further refinement is impossible: Cantera has \n&gt; problems with the noise when approximating derivatives. It seems for \n&gt; me that something is nor correct with calculations of diffusion \n&gt; terms. I did not dig in the code to check equations but it is \n&gt; probably due to artificial diffusion on a coarse mesh. What \n&gt; differences are used to approximate derivatives? Windward or central \n&gt; difference?\n&gt; Best regards, Anatoli\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dave Goodwin&quot; &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you send me an example flame script or program that shows the \n&gt; problem?

Radulescu&quot; &lt;matei@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one computes the the free-flame structure (say H2+air at \n&gt; PTN),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the equilibrium temperature obtained is different from the true\n&gt; &gt; &gt; adiabatic flame temperature obtained via a direct equilibrium\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calculation, using the same thermo data. The differences are on \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; order of 10K for the example given. Likewise, the enthalpy in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flame of the equilibrium products is NOT found equal to reactants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enthalpy, although theoretically, they should be equal. This \n&gt; leads me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to suspect that the non-conservative flame calculations introduces\n&gt; &gt; &gt; order 1 errors in the species concentrations of the products,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consistent with the results of the simulations! Are these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *acceptable* errors???\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n\n"}}
