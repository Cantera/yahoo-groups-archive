For example, suppose the reaction\n\nC10H22 + H &lt;=&gt; C10H21 + H2\n\nhas a net rate of progress of 1.0e-5 kmol/m^3/s, and is the only \nreaction involving both C10H22 and C10H21.  Then on a diagram following \nelemental carbon, the net carbon flux from C10H22 to C10H21 would be \n10*(1.0E-5) = 1.0E-4 kmol/m^3/s.\n\nIf you were following elemental H, then the flux connecting these two \nspecies would be 21*(1.0E-5), since 21 of the H atoms in C10H22 end up \nin C10H21, and one ends up in H2.  Of course if these two species are \ninvolved in multiple reactions, then the flux is summed over the \ncontributions from each one.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Oct 11, 2005, at 12:38 AM, albrechtheinzel wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello Cantera/Mixmaster-user,\n&gt; can anybody tell me which unit has the flux in the reactionpath\n&gt; diagrams of mixmaster?
