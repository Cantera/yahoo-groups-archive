But couldn&#39;t figure\n&gt; out the destination folder to copy ctml_writer.py. My operation system\n&gt; is Redhat linux (Fedora). I installed cantera in \n&gt; &quot;/home/zhiwei/Cantera&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please advise me how to solve this problme.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; Zhiwei\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The &#39;check&#39; script is run whenever the &#39;cttmp&#39; script fails, to see if\n&gt; the problem is with the Cantera installation. Unfortunately the\n&gt; single-line &#39;check&#39; script will always fail, since it tries to import\n&gt; module &#39;ctml_writer&#39; from the Cantera package (where it used to be),\n&gt; instead of importing it directly. The workaround is to copy file\n&gt; &#39;ctml_writer.py&#39; from the &#39;site_packages&#39; folder in the Python Library\n&gt; folder to the &#39;Cantera&#39; folder within &#39;site_packages&#39;. it seems to me\n&gt; now that running the &#39;check&#39; script is more trouble than it is worth,\n&gt; and I am removing this step from the procedure followed to translate\n&gt; input files.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
