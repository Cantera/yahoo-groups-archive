To do this I should clean the \nprojects&#39; =\r\noptions removing references to unused libraries and correct \nthe directory&#39;=\r\ns paths. To check the build, I ran the flamespeed.cpp \ndemo from the direct=\r\nory Cxx/demos. When doing this I encountered a \nfew minor problems:  \n1.\t F=\r\nile ck2ctml.cpp. I changed iterators low.begin() and \nhigh.begin() to the r=\r\neferences to the first objects:\n   addFloatArray(f,&quot;coeffs&quot;,low.size(),&low=\r\n[0]);\naddFloatArray(fh,&quot;coeffs&quot;,high.size(),&high[0]); \n\n2.\tFunction ck2ctm=\r\nl produces a file where a node &quot;reactionArray&quot; \nhas a child &quot;include&quot; with =\r\nthe information about number of reactions \nin the mechanism. The program cr=\r\nashes when using this file as input \nfor the calculation of a free flame. A=\r\nfter removing this &quot;include&quot; \nnode the program does not chrashes. It seems =\r\nthat this node has no \ninfluence on the results of the calculations. Can th=\r\nis node be safely \nremoved or it is used in other parts of the Cantera?    =\r\n\n\n3.\tWhen using oxydizer with the mole fraction of oxygen higher \nthan that=\r\n in air, the program crashes. It happens in the function \nsetFixedTemperatu=\r\nre. The reason is that the position of the fixed \ntemperature of 900 K in t=\r\nhe example is directly after the first \ngridpoint. Therefore, the variable =\r\nm1 remains equal to 0 and when the \noutlet domain is checked in the loop, t=\r\nhe point of the fixed \ntemperature is put in this domain behind the grid. T=\r\no fix this, the \nflag  addnewpt should be cleared directly after the if ope=\r\nrator: \n \t\t\tif(m=3D=3Dm1&&addnewpt){\n\t\t\taddnewpt =3D false;\n\nAfter correcti=\r\nng these problems, the program ran succesfully and \nproduced the reasonable=\r\n results. To print the results of the \ncalculatios I used the following sta=\r\ntements:\n\nfor(int i =3D 0; i &lt; np; i++)\n\t{\n\t\tflow.setGas(flame.solution()+ =\r\nflame.domain(1).loc\n(),i);\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; flow.grid(i) &lt;&lt;  &quot;&#92;t&quot; &lt;&lt; flow.phase\n()=\r\n.temperature() \n\t\t\t&lt;&lt; &quot;&#92;t&quot; &lt;&lt; flow.phase().density()  \n\t\t\t&lt;&lt; &quot;&#92;t&quot; &lt;&lt; flow.p=\r\nhase().meanMolecularWeight\n()  \n&lt;&lt; &quot;&#92;t&quot; &lt;&lt; flow.phase().moleFraction(&quot;CO2&quot;)=\r\n &lt;&lt;  std::endl;\n\t}\n\nIs it a correct method to get the gas object in the gri=\r\ndpoint i?  \n\nI will run a few tests with different parameters  to compare t=\r\nhe \nCantera results with the Chemkin II calculations. At present, I am \nqui=\r\nte happy with the performance of the Cantera solver. \n\nThank you very much =\r\nfor the excellent work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnatoli Mokhov\n\n  \n              \n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
