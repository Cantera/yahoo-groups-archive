Is\nit p=\r\nossible to include time-dependent rates in a chemical kinetics\ncomputation =\r\nin cantera?  Specifically, I am interested in including\nmolecule self-shiel=\r\nding.  I was pointed to cantera by someone here as\na possibility for my res=\r\nearch, but haven&#39;t been able to find an answer\nto this question in the docu=\r\nmentation and, so, don&#39;t want to spend too\nmuch time learning how to use ca=\r\nntera only to find that it can&#39;t do\nwhat I need it to.  Thanks for your hel=\r\np.\n\n-Jeffrey\n\n\n"}}
