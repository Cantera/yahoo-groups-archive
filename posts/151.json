But for those who are brave of\nheart, you can\ncheck out the latest version from the CVS server at the Sourceforge\nsite. Build and\ninstall everything as usual, then in Matlab add both the Cantera\ntoolbox directory to \nthe path, as well as the 1D subdirectory within it. The m-file that\nsolves the \nnonpremixed flame in the figure is &#39;flame2.m&#39; in the &#39;cantera-demos&#39;\ndirectory.\n\nI will be gone on vacation for 2 weeks starting tomorrow, and will\nnot be in email contact at all during this time. The official\nrelease will have to wait until later this month...\n\n\nDave\n\n\n"}}
