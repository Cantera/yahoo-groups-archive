This is a problem.  For functions like IdealGasMix and  \nimportPhase, you should only need to call them once for problems  \ninvolving a single phase (for example, a gas).  Reactors present a few  \ncomplications due to the syntax in which a reactor is created and  \ninitialized in one statement. (I never thought of users creating  \nreactor networks inside loops - I assumed a reactor network would be  \ncreated once, the simulation run, and the results output.)  If you can  \nrestructure your calculation in a way that objects are not created in  \nloops, you&#39;ll have better results in MATLAB. There may be some other  \nmemory issues with the multiphase equilibrium solver - I&#39;m still  \nlooking into that.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jul 8, 2005, at 3:13 PM, jemiller@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Dr Goodwin,\n&gt; Here are the m-files that cause the problem, along with the cti file  \n&gt; containing\n&gt; the thermodynamic data I am using.
