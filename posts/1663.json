The python \nscript \n&gt; would r=\r\nead the file, setup Cantera to run a simulation. The script \n&gt; would need t=\r\no write results to another text file that you then \nread in \n&gt; your Fortran=\r\n program.\n&gt; \n&gt; A colleague did this for testing using Cantera in a commerci=\r\nal \n&gt; application.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Prof. Goodwin\n&gt; &gt; Now I am using Compaq Vis=\r\nual Fortran 6.5 developing code for \n&gt; combustion \n&gt; &gt; simulation in H2ICE =\r\n(Hydrogen ICE). I have noticed Cantera 1.2 \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; have any problem lin=\r\nking with that version of Fortran. Since \n&gt; currently \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have any=\r\n access to &quot;visual studio .net &quot; and Fortran&#39;s \n&gt; compiler \n&gt; &gt; that can be=\r\n linked with Cantera 1.7, Would you please help me to \nfind \n&gt; &gt; Cantera 1.=\r\n2 source files.\n&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance,\n&gt; &gt; Hesam\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
