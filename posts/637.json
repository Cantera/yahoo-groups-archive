It seems very simple. Unfortunately, I have no clue on how\nto write a &quot;script&quot; file. Without learning python language, what would\nbe the basic commands to accomplish this?\n\nSecondly, how do you calculate laminar flame speed? Is it possible?\ni.e., methane/oxidizer?  Can you give me some directions on the commands.\n\nAlso, where and how would I be able to learn more on the functions and\ncapabilities of Cantera and how to use them?\n\n(I managed to fianlly install Cantera on my computer.
