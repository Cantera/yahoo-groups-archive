I am using the burner stabilized flame simulation in \n&gt; Ma=\r\ntlab.  I would like to plot the species mole fraction profiles, but \n&gt; the =\r\nplotSolution command defaults to mass fractions.  I have dug \n&gt; through qui=\r\nte a few m-files looking for a place to change this, with no \n&gt; success.  D=\r\noes anyone know how to use plotSolution to plot mole \n&gt; fraction profiles? =\r\n More importantly, I need to access the raw data of \n&gt; the solution.  I kno=\r\nw that it is saved in an xml file.  How do I pull \n&gt; specific things out of=\r\n the xml file such as temperature, density, and \n&gt; mole fraction profiles? =\r\n \n&gt; Thank you for any advice you can offer.\n&gt; Jeff Miller\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
