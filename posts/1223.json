Simply define ionized species as  \ncontaining the special element &quot;E&quot;.  Foe example, K+ would contain  \none atom of  potassium, and -1 atoms of &quot;E&quot;.\nCantera comes with some thermo files, at least one of which has the  \nthermo properties for gaseous electrons.   As far as equilibrium  \n(Saha equation), the solvers handle charged species fine, and the  \nresults would be the same as computed from the Saha equation.  Take a  \nlook at the Python demo &quot;multiphase_plasma.py&quot; in the demos/Python/ \nequilibrium folder. It has both multiple condensed phases and ionized  \ngaseous species.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn May 24, 2006, at 11:34 AM, Rick_Muller wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in whether anyone is using Cantera to simulate  \n&gt; reactions\n&gt; of ionized species such as would occur in a weakly ionized gas. It\n&gt; seems to me that one could augment the normal kinetics that come out\n&gt; of a GRI reaction mechanism with a Saha equation calculation of the\n&gt; ionization process. However, this would require that electrons be\n&gt; treated as actual species in the reaction mechanism, and I don&#39;t know\n&gt; whether there are serious problems in doing this. Can anyone comment\n&gt; on the suitability of this type of a model?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Rick Muller\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
