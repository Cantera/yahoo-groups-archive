I just installed cantera 1.5.5 too, and I also ran into\nproblems with ctbin.m not being included in the install.\n\nDid you make your own ctbin.m? Or did you edit ck2cti.m? In either\ncase I would be very interested in knowing exactly how you solved this\nproblem if you did already. From what I understand ctbin should return\na text string pointing to where canteras bin catalogue is.\n\nOr maybe someone else have any thaughts?\n\nOn beforehands thanks\n\n-Tor\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;carlmas20032003&quot;\n&lt;carlmas-20032003@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hey,\n&gt;   I&#39;m a new Cantera user and just installed 1.5.5. It appears that \n&gt; ctbin.m is not included in the install, so one can make it based on \n&gt; an old post or edit code that calls it: ck2cti.m. Thoughts?\n&gt;   Also, I have an error that may have to do with my install as others \n&gt; in my class have not had the same problem with old versions, though \n&gt; this is a repeat of post 449 that got no answer...\n&gt;   Using a ChemKin style input file, with thermo data built in, I try \n&gt; to create an ideal gas and get the following warning and error:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) WARNING - I am willing to skip this as it seems minor\n&gt; \n&gt; **** WARNING ****\n&gt; For species CH3O2H, discontinuity in cp/R detected at Tmid = 1000\n&gt; \tValue computed using low-temperature polynomial:  14.1238.\n&gt; \tValue computed using high-temperature polynomial: 14.1516.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2) ERROR - It will not run and this is a repeat from post 449:\n&gt; \n&gt; ???
