We have been having some trouble with the\nmeanmolarmass=\r\n() call.  Sometimes it will work and other times it will\nnot.  (When it wil=\r\nl not work, the code will return a segmentation\nfault within our Fortran co=\r\nde when the value returned is printed out).\n We are guessing at this point =\r\nthat there is some conflict that we\nhave not found yet that makes this call=\r\n work intermittently.  It does\nwork at points in our code though, and so we=\r\n think that this is a\ncoding issue on our side and not a Cantera issue.  \n\n=\r\nDan Smyth\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, Michael Johnson &lt;johns3c@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Cantera group,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am working on channel-flow simulations=\r\n with DASSL, coupled to Cantera.\n&gt; The command meanmolarmass() returns a va=\r\nlue of 0.0000E+00 but if I take \n&gt; the ratio of, say, cp_mole()/cp_mass() i=\r\nt does return the proper value.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m running on Linux, using the demo_f=\r\ntnlib.cpp provided with the\nsource \n&gt; code. I have looked through the heade=\r\nr files under \n&gt; /usr/local/include/cantera but have been unable to find wh=\r\nere \n&gt; meanMolecularWeight() is defined. It is certainly used to calculate =\r\n\n&gt; molar properties with no problem, but I can&#39;t figure out why \n&gt; meanmola=\r\nrmass() is not giving the proper value.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is anyone out there using Cant=\r\nera in Fortran?\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Michael\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
