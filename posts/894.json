When I get to a limit, either the equilibrium solver or reactor \ngives an error (that&#39;s planned), but I would like the loops to keep \niterating past that.  I&#39;m writing the scrip in python and found a &quot;try&quot; \nfunction that allows me to take an error and continue the loop, but I \ndon&#39;t know what the error is called.\n\nThe exmple in Python help is \n\ntry:\n   return 1/0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n   return None\n\nMy question is what is the error given by cantera for the equilibrium \nsolver called? I&#39;ve tried many combinations of the printed debug \ninformation, but none of them seem to work. \n\n\n\n"}}
