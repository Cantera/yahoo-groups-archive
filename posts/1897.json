The differences are on the\norder of 10K for the example given.  =\r\nLikewise, the enthalpy in the\nflame of the equilibrium products is NOT foun=\r\nd equal to reactants\nenthalpy, although theoretically, they should be equal=\r\n.  This leads me\nto suspect that the non-conservative flame calculations in=\r\ntroduces\norder 1 errors in the species concentrations of the products,\ncons=\r\nistent with the results of the simulations!  Are these\n*acceptable* errors?=\r\n?? \n\n\n"}}
