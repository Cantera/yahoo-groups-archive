The biggest problem is that it does not provide a good way  \nto manage memory allocation for cases where the MATLAB code calls C  \nor C++ code that allocates some memory.  MATLAB does not provide  \n&quot;destructors&quot; for classes, so when an object created by a call to  \n&quot;GRI30&quot;, for example, is deleted, only the MATLAB variables are  \nreleased, not any memory allocated by Cantera.\nThis is a fundamental limitation of the object model used in MATLAB,  \nunlike the much more robust object model of Python.\n\nI always get a bit nervous when I hear people describing &quot;big&quot;  \ncalculations done using Cantera and MATLAB.  My recommendation would  \nbe to switch to Python, or even go all the way to C++...\n&gt;\n&gt; p.s.: just a tip:\n&gt; I&#39;ve recognized a &quot;pointer like&quot; behaviour of solution variables in\n&gt; MATLAB.\n&gt; if you do something like:\n&gt; g1=GRI30;\n&gt; g2=g1;\n&gt; set(g1,&#39;T&#39;,400);\n&gt; The set command will have effect on BOTH variables g1 and g2!!!!\n&gt;\nThe MATLAB objects just store pointers to the underlying C++ objects;  \nthe statement &quot;g2=g1&quot; copies the pointer. If you want a new,  \nindependent object, you have to call a constructor. So you would need  \nto write:\ng1=GRI30;\ng2=GRI30;\ninstead of assigning g1 to g2.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
