We are u=\r\nsing Python 2.5, numarray \n1.5.2 and Cantera 1.7.0 on Windows XP.  We are u=\r\nsing python for \ntesting mechanism and determining calculation sequence.  H=\r\nis python \nscript runs to completion on his machines (giving similar answer=\r\ns to \nChemkin btw).  However on 2 machines I run the script on I get the \nf=\r\nollowing error:\n\n[CVODES ERROR]  CVode\n  At t =3D 0 and h =3D 0.0013093, th=\r\ne corrector convergence test failed \nrepeatedly or with |h| =3D hmin.\n\nThe =\r\ncantera call that triggers this is Interface::advanceCoverages\n\nWhat is int=\r\neresting is that I have built a C++ dll following his \npython script logic =\r\nand can call the function from a test program and \nit runs to completion on=\r\n my machine.  When my cooleague builds and \nruns this executable at his sit=\r\ne he gets the CVODES Error.\n\nI have the Cantera 1.7 source and the SUNDIALS=\r\n 2.3.0 source and have \nbuilt the libraries with MS VS .NET 2003.  When CVO=\r\nDES builds it \nreports:\nc:&#92;.. ..&#92;sundials&#92;src&#92;cvodes&#92;cvodea.c(811) : warnin=\r\ng C4700: local \nvariable &#39;hB&#39; used without having been initialized\nThis doe=\r\ns look like bugs I&#39;ve seen in iterative solvers before where \nthere was an =\r\nunitialized local variable.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
