There is a chamber ( diameter: 80 [mm] length: \n300 [mm]). Inside, mixture: methane+Air (stoichiometry). Ignition : \ncenter chamber. I would like to know (depend on, how much I use \nchemical reactions) amount of individual compounds, temperature, \npressure, velocity vs time and grid mesh.\n\nRegards\n\nKochzg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
