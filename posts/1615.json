This is necessary to clean up some dependency issues  \nbetween different Cantera libraries, and will result in a layout that  \nis much easier to understand.\n\nI have tagged the current version of the repository with the tag  \n&quot;Release_1_7_0_final&quot;.  You can continue to check out the code with  \nthe current directory structure using this tag.\n\nLater today I will begin moving files in the repository. The  \nreorganized version will be 1.7.1.  If you are building Cantera with  \nVisual Studio under Windows, hold off on updating from CVS until I  \nhave a chance to recreate the Visual Studio project files.\n\nSoon after this reorganization is complete, some additional  \ncapabilities will be added, including the ability to access new  \nequations of state from Python or MATLAB (e.g. liquid electrolytes),  \nand a much improved ability to specify time-dependent attributes in  \nreactor networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
