Warthesen wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Dr. Goodwin,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, working with  \n&gt; Dr.\n&gt; Girshick, and we are interested in using Cantera to work with our  \n&gt; complex\n&gt; silane plasma chemistry mechanism.  I have attempted to install  \n&gt; version 1.4\n&gt; for Unix, and so far I have not gotten through the &quot;make install&quot;  \n&gt; step.  I\n&gt; have spent some time following the paths of compilation, and I believe  \n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; making progress, but I thought you might have a simple suggestion of  \n&gt; how to\n&gt; get Cantera up and running.  The problem seems to be that the necessary\n&gt; files are not present in the correct directories, or the correct  \n&gt; compiler is\n&gt; not being used - I&#39;m not entirely sure, but trying to compile each  \n&gt; small\n&gt; file individually does not seem efficient.  I appreciate any advice  \n&gt; you can\n&gt; give, but I will keep working on it as is.  Also, I just wanted to let  \n&gt; you\n&gt; know that we are very excited to work with Cantera.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sarah Warthesen\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: dggoodwin [mailto:dgoodwin@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 15, 2002 11:00 AM\n&gt; To: cantera@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [cantera] progress report\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes I wonder what I&#39;ve gotten myself into with Cantera... it\n&gt; turns out (big surprise) that developing a large software project is\n&gt; A Big Job. Particularly when one has a day job...\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, significant progress is being made, although it may not seem\n&gt; like it (to anyone but me). In particular, the first really-useful\n&gt; Cantera application is almost ready - a one dimensional reacting-flow\n&gt; application, that can be used to simulate:\n&gt;\n&gt; - 1D laminar flames\n&gt; - counterflow flames\n&gt; - stagnation-point flows with surface chemistry (CVD, catalysis, etc.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I expect it will be ready to ship in a couple of weeks... stay tuned.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; cantera-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
