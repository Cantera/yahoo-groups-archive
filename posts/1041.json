For=\r\n the reaction you \ncite, specify it as\n\n2 CH4 + 3 O2 =3D&gt; 2 CO + 4 H2O\n\nThe=\r\nn cut the pre-exponential term in the rate expression by two, since \nas wri=\r\ntten here this reaction consumes two CH4, instead of 1, as \noriginally writ=\r\nten.  Since you are specifying the reaction orders for \nthe reactants, the =\r\nstoichiometric coefficients will not be used in \ncomputing the reaction rat=\r\ne of progress, only in converting from rate \nof progress to species product=\r\nion rates.\n\nCantera requires integer stoichiometric coefficients since this=\r\n allows \nusing some faster numerical algorithms and there is no loss of \nge=\r\nnerality, since every balanced reaction can be written with integer \nstoich=\r\niometric coefficients.  In particular, species production rates \nare comput=\r\ned from the reaction rates of progress using integer addition \noperations, =\r\ninstead of floating-point multiplies. Also, except when a \nreaction order i=\r\ns explicitly specified (as in this reaction), rates of \nprogress are comput=\r\ned using integer multiply operations, instead of \nfloating-point exponentia=\r\ntion.   All of this turns out to make a big \ndifference in the performance =\r\nusing large mechanisms, and is one main \nreason that flame calculations, fo=\r\nr example, are often faster with \nCantera than with &quot;other well-known softw=\r\nare packages.&quot;  (There are \nother reasons, too.)\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jul 6, 2004, a=\r\nt 7:32 AM, kvirgilm wrote:\n\n&gt; I am trying to implement a &#39;global&#39; mechanism=\r\n for the gas phase\n&gt; reactions.\n&gt; I am specifying the reactions as such in =\r\nthe cti file:\n&gt;\n&gt; reaction( &quot; CH4 + 1.5 O2 =3D&gt; CO + 2 H2O &quot;, [5.3044e8, 0.=\r\n1902, 13940.0],\n&gt; order\n&gt; =3D &quot;CH4:0.587917 O2:0.620861&quot;)\n&gt;\n&gt; When I go to =\r\nconvert it to xml, I get the error:\n&gt;\n&gt; cti2ctml methane-3step.cti\n&gt; Traceb=\r\nack (most recent call last):\n&gt;   File &quot;./.cttmp.py&quot;, line 7, in ?\n&gt;     exe=\r\ncfile(file)\n&gt;   File &quot;./methane-3step.cti&quot;, line 98, in ?\n&gt;     reaction( &quot;=\r\n CH4 + 1.5 O2 =3D&gt; CO + 2 H2O &quot;, [5.3044e8, 0.1902,\n&gt; 13940.0],\n&gt; order =3D=\r\n &quot;CH4:0.587917 O2:0.620861&quot;)\n&gt;   File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/ctm=\r\nl_writer.py&quot;, line 643, in\n\n&gt; __init__\n&gt;     self._r =3D getReactionSpecies=\r\n(r)\n&gt;   File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/ctml_writer.py&quot;, line 323, i=\r\nn\n&gt; getReactionSpecies\n&gt;     n =3D int(t)\n&gt; ValueError: invalid literal for=\r\n int(): 1.5\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a simple fix to allow for non-integer stoichiome=\r\ntric\n&gt; coefficients?
