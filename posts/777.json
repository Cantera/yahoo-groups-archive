I suppose you&#39;re decreasing the \nenthalpy by calling &#39;setState_HP&#39; first with the desired enthalpy and \npressure and initial composition.  I bet the problem is that the \nresulting initial temperature is so low that it is either out of range \nfor the thermo data, or causes numerical problems for other reasons.\n\nCan you run the problem fixing (T,P) rather than (H,P)?\n\nYou might also try the new equilibrium solver, which doesn&#39;t use \nChemEquil.  In Python, you can access it by creating a &#39;Mixture&#39; \ncontaining the gas phase:\n\ngas = GRI30()\nmix = Mixture([(gas, 1.0)])\nmix.equilibrate(&#39;HP&#39;)\nprint mix\n\nAnd if you want to include a condensed phase, you can do it like this:\ngas = GRI30()\ncarbon = importPhase(&#39;graphite.cti&#39;)\nmix = Mixture([(gas, 1.0), (carbon, 0.0)])\nmix.equilibrate(&#39;HP&#39;)\nprint mix\n\nDepending on the version of Cantera you have this may or may not work.  \nIt definitely works with the prerelease of version 1.6, available by \nCVS.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Apr 29, 2005, at 11:05 AM, jcs6a50 wrote:\n\n&gt; All,\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone had trouble getting ChemEquil to behave?
