This will always  \nretrieve version 1.7.0, even after the development version moves  \nbeyond 1.7.0.\n\nA unix tar.gz file is also available for download.  It may be built  \nin the usual way, as described here: http://blue.caltech.edu/~dgg/ \nhtml/cantera-build.html.\n\nWindows developers can get the latest Windows source version from CVS  \ntoo. The &quot;win32&quot; module has also been updated to version 1.7.0.  Some  \nnew features for Windows are:\n\n1. Support for sundials  All you need to do is download the sundials  \n2.3 source code and place it in a directory at the same level as the  \nCantera directory; building the Cantera Visual C++ &quot;solution&quot; will  \nautomatically build sundials too (or at least those parts used by  \nCantera).\n\n2. Enhanced and functioning C++ demo project files.  All C++ demos  \navailable in the unix version are now available in Windows too.   \nProject files are automatically installed in the &quot;demos/C++&quot; folder  \nin the Cantera installation directory.\n\n\nGeneral enhancements:\n\nVersion 1.7.0 should compile with few if any problems on linux,  \ncygwin, Mac OS X, and Windows.  Some things that are new since  \nversion 1.6 are:\n\n1. A simplified interface to Cantera&#39;s boundary value problem  \nsolver.  You can easily solve many different boundary value problems  \nwith class &quot;BoundaryValueProblem&quot;.  See &quot;cantera/apps/bvp&quot; for more  \ndetails.\n\n2. More robust equilibrium solver.  The ChemEquil solver has been  \nmade much more robust.  Now it should rarely fail, even on &quot;hard&quot;  \nproblems.\n\n3. Sensitivity analysis.  So far implemented only for reactor network  \nproblems.  See file &quot;demos/python/reactors/sensitivity1.py&quot;.\n\n4. New types of reactors:  FlowReactor, and ConstPressureReactor.  \nFlowReactor simulates isentropic flow in a duct, with &quot;time&quot; replaced  \nby &quot;position&quot; in the duct.  FlowReactor objects must be used alone  \nand cannot be connected to other reactor types (for which time is  \nreally time).  ConstPressureReactor keeps the pressure constant, even  \nwithout installing a flexible wall to do the job. In general, this  \nwill be more robust numerically than do-it-yourself constant-pressure  \nreactors.\n\n5. Other stuff.  Ability to modify NASA polynomial coefficients, and  \nother things I have forgotten now.  Version 1.6 was a long time  \nago... if you have been updatingg regularly from CVS these features  \nhave been available for some time.\n\nOne thing that has not been touched is the MATLAB interface.\n\nLet me know if there are any problems, particularly any build issues.\n\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
