Cantera is using exactly =\r\nthe \n&gt; same algorithm to solve the 1D flame problem. What is different in \n=\r\n&gt; comparison with Premix, Cantera considers 1D flame as a limiting case \n&gt; =\r\nof axisymmetric flame. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t use both Python and \n&gt; Matlab=\r\n, therefore, I cannot answer all your questions. In particular,\n&gt; 1.\tTfix i=\r\ns a fixed temperature necessary to remove translational \n&gt; symmetry from th=\r\ne governing equations. For free flames, if T(x) is \n&gt; solution, T(x+x0) is =\r\nalso solution with arbitrary x0. By putting \n&gt; temperature in some point eq=\r\nual to some fixed temperature we fix the \n&gt; flame position. Usually you can=\r\n put Tfix equal to 800 K.\n&gt; 2.\tZ1 is a relative position (from 0 to 1, usua=\r\nlly 0.7). Zero \n&gt; approximation for all variables is linear changed on [0,Z=\r\n1] from \n&gt; inlet to equilibrium values. You should play with this value to =\r\nreach \n&gt; faster convergence of solution. Clearly, if you make Z1 smaller, y=\r\nou \n&gt; expect high burning velocities (flame thickness is small).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope =\r\nthat this helps, \n&gt; Best regards, Anatoli\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;transfertoschool&quot; &lt;ademator@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have been looking=\r\n to create a Matlab model of a freely propagating\n&gt; &gt; flame.
