You can see what the CVODE error is \nif you run MATLAB in a shell window, rather than through its graphical \ninterface (although I don&#39;t know if this is possible in Windows). I do \nit by giving the command\n\nmatlab -nodisplay -nojvm -nosplash\n\nWhen I run your matlab script in this way, I see the error message \nCVODE prints:\n\nCVode-- At t=4.6612e-13 and step size h=3.52863e-19, the error test\nfailed repeatedly or with |h| = hmin.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t show up when running MATLAB the usual way, since CVODE \nprints this to the standard output, which MATLAB seems to ignore.\n\nAnyway, this message means that CVODE is unable to take a step, even \none as small as 10^-19 s. This usually occurs when some reaction has a \nhuge rate, either due to some error in the mechanism,  or in some cases \nto initial conditions. (For example, starting with a composition of \njust H and O at 300 K might do this.)  In your case, it looks like one \nreaction has an extremely large reverse rate of progress - 10^17 \nkmol/m3/s  (do &#39;rop_r(gas)&#39; in MATLAB to see this).  I suspect that \nthis is causing your problems. It may be that the forward rate constant \nis too large, or that the thermochemistry for some species is in error.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Nov 26, 2004, at 1:52 AM, martin olausson wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m now using Cantera in fluent (through an udf) with a pyrolysis\n&gt; mechanism I found in the literature.

I can get what I think is the same error in matlab, by\n&gt; creating a gas with random mass fractions, and advance it in a reactor\n&gt; (see matlab script and cti-file attached).
