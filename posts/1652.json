By  \n&gt; default, python tries to build a universal binary. This warn=\r\ning just  \n&gt; means that your compiled code will run on ppc architectures, b=\r\nut not  \n&gt; i386 ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; The file setup.m is generated and then later rem=\r\noved in the build  \n&gt; process. Actually all it does is change to the &#39;cante=\r\nra&#39; directory  \n&gt; and then invoke &#39;buildux.m&#39; to build the Cantera toolbox.=\r\n If Matlab  \n&gt; can&#39;t find the setup.m file, check that the current director=\r\ny is on  \n&gt; the Matlab search path.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing to be aware of on the ma=\r\nc: Matlab R2006b for the PowerPC  \n&gt; architecture is compiled with g++ 3.3,=\r\n and so all of Cantera must be  \n&gt; compiled with this version of g++ too to=\r\n use it in Matlab.  On the  \n&gt; other hand, Python is compiled with g++ 4.x,=\r\n and Cantera must be  \n&gt; built with this compiler version to use it in Pyth=\r\non. What this means  \n&gt; is that if you want to use Cantera in both Python a=\r\nnd Matlab, you  \n&gt; need to build two separate versions.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the Intel i=\r\n386 platform, Matlab R2006b is compiled with g++ 4.x,  \n&gt; and this problem =\r\ndoesn&#39;t arise.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On May 21, 2007, at 8:30 AM, agentesilv=\r\nia wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I still haven&#39;t been able to install Cantera but I admit t=\r\nhat in  \n&gt; &gt; this days I&#39;ve been quite\n&gt; &gt; busy=85\n&gt; &gt; As I&#39;ve said before =\r\nthere is no `setup.m&#39; script in the Cantera/ \n&gt; &gt; matlab folder but looking=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; better I&#39;ve seen an error in the python building procedure that  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\noccurs just before the\n&gt; &gt; Matlab building procedure: it seems that a wrong=\r\n  `=96arch i386&#39; is  \n&gt; &gt; issued to the g++\n&gt; &gt; compiler just before the co=\r\nrrect `-arch ppc&#39; and this generates a  \n&gt; &gt; lot of errors=85\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
