Matplotlib can use either one, but the option needs to be \nspecified at compile time.  So you may need to compile matplotlib \nconfigured to use numarray rather than Numeric.\n\nIf you compile Cantera from source, you can use either Numeric or \nnumarray. You have to set HAS_NUMERIC in &#39;configure&#39; to use Numeric. \nAlso if you do use Numeric, then make sure numarray is not on your \nsystem, since the Cantera Python module tries to load numarray if it is \navailable, whether or not you set HAS_NUMERIC.  This is a bug that has \nbeen fixed in version 1.6. It is recommended though to upgrade \neverything Cantera and matplotlib to numarray and remove Numeric from \nyour system.\n\n\nOn Feb 1, 2005, at 4:20 PM, osman wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello All,\n&gt; I had 1.5.4 installed (windows 2000) and it was working fine.
