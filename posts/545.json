In the program we set the\n&gt; temperature to 1001K and Pressure to OneAtm and also specify the\n&gt; number of moles of H2:2, O2:1, N2:4. After this the gas is inserted\n&gt; in the reactor and a simulation is carried out. My question is the\n&gt; reactor volume is given a default value of 1m3 at the beginning of\n&gt; the simulation. My question is when we have set the temperature,\n&gt; pressure and number of moles inserted in the reactor, shouldnt the\n&gt; reactor have a volume different from the default value of 1m3?\n&gt; (approximately the value obtained from the ideal gas formula?)\n&gt;\n&gt; Surinder\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
