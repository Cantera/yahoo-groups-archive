Now we would like to keep the\n&gt; concentration of one of the substances (Methane) constant. In other\n&gt; words: It should not take part in the overall reaction.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the easiest way to do this? Should we only take a part of the\n&gt; gas into our considerations or exists there a way to tell CANTERA\n&gt; which reactions are not desired?\n&gt;\n&gt; We would be grateful for any piece of advice.\n&gt;\n&gt;           Thomas Brunner and Markus Wuethrich, ETH Zurich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
