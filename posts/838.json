In the model\nmethanol undergoes a dissociative adsorption with CH3O adsorption on\none type of site and H adsorption on a different type of site.  I set\nup the problem using four different surface phases with all of their\nassociated species.  In particular there is a surface I called\n&quot;Cu(S1)&quot; containing species CU(S1) and CH3O(S1) (among others) and a\nsurface I called &quot;Cu(S1a)&quot; containing the species CU(S1a) and H(S1a).\n&quot;ct2ctml&quot; exits with an error on the reaction CU(S1) + CU(S1a) + CH3OH\n=&gt; CH3O(S1) + H(S1a) claiming &quot;A surface reaction may contain at most\none surface phase.&quot;  Is there a work-around for this?  If there is I\nhope it isn&#39;t too cumbersome because I have 11 other reactions in the\nmodel with the same difficulty.\n\nThanks for all help.\n\nDave Mikolaitis\nUniversity of Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
