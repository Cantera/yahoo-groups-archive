I found the \nexample on PSR in CPP. Would you have an example a PLR? My interest \nis simplied gas turbine combuster modeling. I have been very \nsuccesful with gas turbine performance modeling via Cantera/Python \nrecently and have duplicated previous efforts in C using my \ntranslation of the NASA CEC program. I have considering \nincorporating my old C version of Lee-Kessler and BWRS EOS I use for \ngas compressor modeling, Etc..into Cantera but do not have Fortran \n(I have Visual-Studio 2003 though or could use GNU tools). Have \nothers interested in Gas Turbine Performance and/or Gas Turbine \nEmissions Modeling tried using Cantera? I would like to start some \none-D modeling with PSR and PLR&#39;s in Python to investigate the \npossiblities and have not started yet. I would be interested in any \nexperience or tip you would have time to share. \n\n\n\n"}}
