But it seems Microsoft C++ may be \nmore restrictive about this.  (I think you can turn off the Microsoft \nC++ extensions with a compiler flag.)\n\nThat having been said, I think it is true that it is now considered bad \nstyle to begin names with an underscore, single or double.  It used to \nbe ok, and the widely-used &quot;Design Patterns&quot; book does this quite a \nbit.  I wrote &quot;utilities.h&quot; when I was reading Design Patterns, and \nadopted their notation.  But to avoid problems, I&#39;ll see if I can \nremove leading underscores from names in Cantera. Fortunately they are \nonly used in a few places.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Nov 18, 2005, at 8:14 AM, Haldir wrote:\n\n&gt; The current CVS version isn&#39;t compiling properly on VS .NET 2005 out \n&gt; of the\n&gt; box, the compiler complains about errors in the utilities.h\n&gt; c:&#92;cantera&#92;include&#92;cantera&#92;kernel&#92;utilities.h(91) : error C2059: syntax\n&gt; error : &#39;)&#39;.\n&gt; I asked a fellow c++ wiz and he suggested to remove all the leading\n&gt; underscores in the variable names and that did the trick.\n&gt; Example: ++__begin does not work, but ++begin does.\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I know, using leading underscores in variable names is \n&gt; generally\n&gt; not recommended.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Haldir\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
