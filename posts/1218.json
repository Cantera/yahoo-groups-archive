A time based HT function is also possible. The wall\narea cannot be v=\r\naried over time.\n\nI have a zeroD piston simulation in Cantera with the wall=\r\n acting\nas the piston crown.\n\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to simulat=\r\ne a varying wall area,\nwithout modifying the source code. (The time based H=\r\nT function could\nbe used if the reservoir temperature is accessible at each=\r\n time step).\nDoes anyone know if this is possible. \n\nThanks,\nAdam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
