Can you=\r\n say me if I\nneed something else?\nIs it possible that the errors are due to=\r\n the installing directory? I\nhave tried to install in /usr/local/share/cant=\r\nera.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nChristian Tomasi\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Cantera Users,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; There were a few post asking how to build the Cantera toolbox for \n&gt; Matl=\r\nab under linux but\n&gt; I didn&#39;t see any post describing how so I decide to po=\r\nst my\nexperience here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since the GCC version and Glibc version came wi=\r\nth Matlab are different \n&gt; from the one with\n&gt; which we build cantera, You =\r\nwould probably see a message like this when \n&gt; you use the\n&gt; toolbox:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n/usr/local/matlab/bin/glnx86/../../sys/os/glnx86/libgcc_s.so.1:\n&gt; version `=\r\nGCC_3.3&#39; not found (required by /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6).\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sur=\r\ne about OS X but the linux workaround is to let Matlab use \n&gt; the library o=\r\nn\n&gt; your system instead of the one came with Matlab. Try this:\n&gt; \n&gt; cd $MAT=\r\nLAB\n&gt; cd sys/os/glnx86\n&gt; mkdir old\n&gt; mv libstdc++.* libg2c.* libgcc_s* old\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Then recompile your Cantera and install the new toolbox. This should \n=\r\n&gt; work for both linux\n&gt; and OS X. I made it work with SuSe 10 using gcc 4.0=\r\n.2.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ricky\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
