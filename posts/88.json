Some brief documentation is at \nhttp://blue.caltech.edu/cantera_dist/doc/zerod.pdf\n\nIn this version, you can:\n\n  - work with networks of reactors\n\n  - define reservoirs to provide constant inlet conditions\n\n  - allow heat transfer between reactors\n    * specified heat transfer coefficient, or\n    * specified heat flux as a function of time\n\n  - use different reaction mechanisms in different reactors,\n    (even if one flows into the other)\n\n  - define flexible or moving walls between reactors\n    * volume change rate linear in Delta P, or\n    * specified dV/dt as a function of time\n    * heating/cooling due to adiabatic compression/expansion\n\n  - connect reactors with flow lines\n    * install mass flow controllers\n    * install valves\n  \n  - create CSTRs, batch reactors, etc.\n\n\nThe documentation describes where to get the installation file for \nWindows. The source distribution (needed for every non-Windows \nplatform) has not yet been updated, but will be in a day or so.\nSeveral examples are described in the documentation, and two zero-D \nkinetics scripts are included among the example scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
