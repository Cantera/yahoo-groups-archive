I have download latest relea=\r\nse of \nCantera 1.7.0 (including windows installer (.msi) and its source\n(.z=\r\nip)). I&#39;ve installed installer. But I really don&#39;t know how to set \nmy Envi=\r\nronmental Variables for Fortran application. I couldn&#39;t compile \ndemo.f90 w=\r\nhen several errors such as &quot;Could not find the file \ncantera.mod&quot; appeared.=\r\n Shall copy some specific files at specific \nfolders? Is it necessary to in=\r\nstall python? (I&#39;ve already installed \nit!) Any useful documents on web?\nOn=\r\ne moer thing is I have to write my progrm in Fortran90. So i can&#39;t \nuse pyt=\r\nhon, matlab or C++!\nSpecial thanks for your help!\nRegards, Hesam\n\n\n\n"}}
