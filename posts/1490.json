(ex: cantera.lib, oneD.lib\netc.) I have two DLL files =\r\nin the Cantera directory: msvcp71.dll and\nmsvcr71.dll. Is there a way to bu=\r\nild the demo without the lib files. I\nthought lib files were required at li=\r\nnk time to link to the dll files.\nHas anybody faced this issue and got it s=\r\nolved?\nThanks in advance, Shyam.\n\n\n"}}
