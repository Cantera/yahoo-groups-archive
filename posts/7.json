You can access it at \nhttp://blue.caltech.edu/cantera.pdf. Like Cantera itself, the manual \nis a work in progress, and is subject to change...\n\nA number of you have e-mailed me with various questions, problems, \netc. I am happy to answer all e-mail correspondence, but I would \nencourage you to post these messages here if the topic is potentially \nof interest to others. If you are having problems with something, it \nis likely someone else is too. I get an e-mail message from Yahoo as \nsoon as any message is posted, so my reply will be no slower than if \nyou e-mail me directly. \n\nI&#39;m interested in hearing the comments of anyone who has tried to \ndownload, install, and use Cantera. Have you tried the Python \ninterface? Or CtLib? How did they work? etc. \n\nA final note: much of the Cantera web site will be down tomorrow \nmorning due to a necessary power shutdown in the building housing the \nhost machines. Should be up by noon.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
