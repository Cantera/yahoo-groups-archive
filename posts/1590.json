My results are about 7% too=\r\n high.  When I checked the source code, I found the \nline m_do_soret(false)=\r\n in the file StFlow.cpp and it seems to me that this would force the \nSoret=\r\n effect to be off.  I&#39;ve run the same grid with multicomponent and mixture =\r\naveraged \ntransport with different results - the mixture averaged is slight=\r\nly higher as I would expect.  \nI have changed the line to m_do_soret(true),=\r\n recompiled and it didn&#39;t change the result.
