You are \nright that the configure script detects OS X, and skips building the \nblas and lapack libs from source code.  But it should also add \n&#39;-framework Accelerate&#39; to the compilation options.  Is it not doing \nthis for you?  It works fine on my Mac, but perhaps some tweaks are \nstill needed.  Perhaps I should make using the Accelerate framework \noptional.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Aug 23, 2005, at 2:41 PM, jcs6a50 wrote:\n\n&gt; I tried building cantera on OS X, and found that the blas and lapack\n&gt; libs are not built.  In cantera-1.6.0/config/configure, there is a\n&gt; statement that effectively prevents lapack and blas from being build\n&gt; on OS X.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I remove this statement, the blas libraries build, but there are\n&gt; undefined symbols in them:\n&gt;\n&gt; _dgemv_\n&gt; _dgemm_\n&gt; _dtrsm_\n&gt; _xerbla_\n&gt; _dswap_\n&gt; _lsame_\n&gt; _dger_\n&gt; _dscal_\n&gt; _idamax_\n&gt; _s_cmp\n&gt; _s_copy\n&gt; _dtrmm_\n&gt; _s_cat\n&gt; _dtrmv_\n&gt; _s_paus\n&gt;\n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; James\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
