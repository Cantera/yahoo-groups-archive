I am using the instructions in the win32 directory that\ndoes not require Fortran ( see here:\nhttp://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cantera/win32/README?view=markup ).\n\nUnfortunately, when I get to the &quot;make win&quot; step, in which matlab is\nopened and mex is run to compile ctmethods.dll, I get errors about\nlooking for dll&#39;s and lib files in the FORTRAN directory.\n\nI found some of the DLL&#39;s  such as DFORMD.DLL available on-line, so\nwas able to move past those errors. I am stuck now with\nLINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file\n&#39;C:/MATLAB7/bin/win32/dformd.lib&#39; \n(My configuration file has Fortran_Lib_Dir=&quot;C:/Matlab7/Bin/Win32&quot;)\n\nAny ideas on what step I am missing?  Is this not actually a Fortran\nlib? If not, are there any thoughts on where I might find it (it\ndoesn&#39;t seem to live on my machine; I do not have Fortran installed).\n Otherwise, how can I modify my setup so that it does not require this\nfile?  \nThanks in Advance,\nR\n\n\n\n\n"}}
