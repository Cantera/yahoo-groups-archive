Specifically, I get results as follows:\n\n(GAS_OBJECT is a Cantera gri-mech30 gas object)\n\n&gt;&gt; GAS_OBJECT\n[...]\n                           X                 Y   \n                     -------------     ------------ \n                H2   0.000000e+000     0.000000e+000\n                 H   1.000000e+000     1.000000e+000\n                 O   0.000000e+000     0.000000e+000\n[...]\n\n&gt;&gt; setmassfractions(GAS_OBJECT, &#39;H2:0.5,H:0.5&#39;, &#39;TP&#39;)\n[...]\n                           X                 Y   \n                     -------------     ------------ \n                H2   3.264775e-001     3.333333e-001\n                 H   6.529549e-001     3.333333e-001\n                 O   0.000000e+000     0.000000e+000\n                O2   2.056763e-002     3.333333e-001\n                OH   0.000000e+000     0.000000e+000\n               H2O   0.000000e+000     0.000000e+000\n               HO2   4.471375e-310     7.474886e-309\n              H2O2   4.615671e-170     7.951739e-169\n                 C   0.000000e+000     0.000000e+000\n                CH   0.000000e+000     0.000000e+000\n[...]\n\nThe results are not particularly consistent; if I re-run the same \ncommand immediately afterwards, I get the same result, but if I re-run \nit a while later (after having manipulated GAS_OBJECT), I get \ndifferent results.  Also, sometimes adding space in the mass-fraction \nstring (e.g., &#39;H2:0.5, H:0.5&#39;) will change the results.\n\nAll of my tests have been on version 1.4; however, a colleague of mine \nwho is using 1.5.3 confirmed that this problem is reproducable on his \nmachine.  Further, my colleague was reproducing the results with \ncommands such as &quot;set(GAS_OBJECT,&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;N2:79,O2:21,CH4:6&#39;,&#39;T&#39;,300,&#39;P&#39;,\noneatm)&quot;, which implies that the problem is somewhere deep in the \nCantera code rather than in the Matlab files.\n\nI do note that the setMassFractions function seems to work correctly \nif the mass fractions are specified as a vector; thus, the following \nis what I&#39;ve been using as a workaround in functions where I want to \nspecify the mass fractions as a string:\n\n  setMoleFractions(GAS_OBJECT,Y);\n  setMassFractions(GAS_OBJECT,MoleFractions(GAS_OBJECT));\n\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n"}}
