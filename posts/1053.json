Now we need to decide whether to do it or not.  \nI&#39;d like to get some sense of how useful people feel a Cantera workshop \nwould be, and how many might attend if it were held in Heidelberg on \nSunday, August 6.\n\nIf we do it, I would like much of the workshop to consist of \ncontributed talks from Cantera users on what you are doing with Cantera \nin research or teaching.  But of course I could talk about future \ndirections for Cantera (or whatever else people are interested in) too.\n\nAnother option would be to hold a workshop somewhere else.  This might \nbe preferred by non-combustion Cantera users, who wouldn&#39;t be in \nHeidelberg. (There&#39;s always the &quot;Westin La Cantera&quot; golf resort near \nSan Antonio, Texas...)\n\nLet me know what you think, either by posting to the user&#39;s group, or \nby sending me an email message.\n\nThanks,\nDave\n\n\n"}}
