The tar file was\n&gt; copied in /usr/local and produced a cantera directory after &quot;tar\n&gt; zxvf&quot;.\n&gt; I commented lines associated with the preparation of Fortran, MathLab\n&gt; and Python interfaces (the configure file).CANTERA_ROOT and PATH were\n&gt; fixed to /usr/local/cantera and $CANTERA_ROOT/bin, respectively.\n&gt; I used gcc/g++ 3.3.2 which includes g77. Line F77 in configure was\n&gt; uncommented and its f77 was replaced by gcc. Morevover line containing\n&gt; F90 was commented.\n&gt;\n&gt; ./ configure, make and make install worked.\n&gt;\n&gt; The &quot;make&quot; in examples/cxx ended with:\n&gt;\n&gt; g++ -o ./cxx_examples examples.o kinetics_examples1.o ...\n&gt; /usr/local/cantera/build/lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lre\n&gt; cipes.a(simplx.o)(text+0x4a\n&gt; ): in function &lt;&lt;simplx_&gt;&gt;: undefined reference to `s_pass`\n&gt;\n&gt; The same was reproduced several times and related to:\n&gt; libctlapack\n&gt; libctmath\n&gt; lictblas\n&gt;\n&gt; As a consequence cxx_examples was not generated.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would be very grateful for any help.
