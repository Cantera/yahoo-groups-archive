I&#39;ve tried generating an msi=\r\n \nfile and received multiple errors that I believe are associated with \nthe=\r\n new directory structure.\n\nThanks.\nRusty\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, D=\r\navid Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This message is for those of you who=\r\n are compiling Cantera from  \n&gt; source code from CVS...\n&gt; \n&gt; I am about to =\r\nmake some significant changes to the directory  \n&gt; structure in the Cantera=\r\n source tree, specifically in directory  \n&gt; Cantera/src.  This is necessary=\r\n to clean up some dependency issues  \n&gt; between different Cantera libraries=\r\n, and will result in a layout \nthat  \n&gt; is much easier to understand.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI have tagged the current version of the repository with the tag  \n&gt; &quot;Relea=\r\nse_1_7_0_final&quot;.  You can continue to check out the code \nwith  \n&gt; the curr=\r\nent directory structure using this tag.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later today I will begin movin=\r\ng files in the repository. The  \n&gt; reorganized version will be 1.7.1.  If y=\r\nou are building Cantera \nwith  \n&gt; Visual Studio under Windows, hold off on =\r\nupdating from CVS until I  \n&gt; have a chance to recreate the Visual Studio p=\r\nroject files.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soon after this reorganization is complete, some additio=\r\nnal  \n&gt; capabilities will be added, including the ability to access new  \n&gt;=\r\n equations of state from Python or MATLAB (e.g. liquid \nelectrolytes),  \n&gt; =\r\nand a much improved ability to specify time-dependent attributes \nin  \n&gt; re=\r\nactor networks.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
