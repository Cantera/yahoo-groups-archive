Now it is, at least for water.  \nNow there is a C++ class Water, so you can do things like this:\n\n#include &lt;cantera/PureFluid.h&gt;\n\nmain() {\n    Water w;\n    w.setState_TP(300.0, OneAtm);\n    double s1 = w.entropy_mass();\n    w.setState_SP(s1, 8.0*OneAtm);\n    cout &lt;&lt; w.temperature() &lt;&lt; endl;\n    ...\n    etc.\n    ...\n}\n\nI have also added an example of an open Rankine cycle in C++.  All you \nneed to do is &quot;cvs update&quot;, then build everything and re-install. The \nnew example will appear in the demos folder in the installation \ndirectory. Oh, and I fixed the include statement for \n&quot;../../ext/tpx/...&quot;.  Now this include is in the implementation file, \nnot the header, so it is not needed for application programs. Let me \nknow if you encounter any problems.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jan 6, 2005, at 3:25 PM, rahunt_xyz wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m working on writing some examples in C++, and I&#39;m not sure how to\n&gt; work with PureFluids.  I have two questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; First, I&#39;m not quite sure how to initialize a pure fluid from an XML\n&gt; or CTI file in C++.  For example, I want to write something that would\n&gt; do the equivalent of the following MATLAB code\n&gt; %%%\n&gt; % water = importPhase(&#39;liquidvapor.xml&#39;,&#39;water&#39;);\n&gt; % set(water,&#39;T&#39;,Tmin,&#39;P&#39;,Pmin);\n&gt; %%%\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, I&#39;ve noticed that in my cantera install directory the file\n&gt; lib/kernel/PureFluidPhase.h tries to include two files which do not\n&gt; exist in the cantera install dir\n&gt; #include &quot;../../ext/tpx/Sub.h&quot;\n&gt; #include &quot;../../ext/tpx/utils.h&quot;\n&gt; For now I&#39;ve just copied these two .h files to the appropriate place\n&gt; in my install directory, but what should the structure really be?\n&gt;\n&gt; As always, I really appreciate everyone&#39;s help, particularly Dave\n&gt; Goodwin for being generous with his time and patience!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rebecca\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
