In the beginning you have to choose mdot e.\ng. but it is not used in the further routines anymore. Can anyone\nplease explain shortly how it works, and what would be the best method\nto use. I would really like to calculate some flame speeds for n-\nheptane.\nThanks in advance for an answer\n\nSven\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
