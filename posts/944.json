Using the Matlab version of Cantera 1.6.0\n&gt; under Red Hat Linux Enterprise edition with kernel 2.6.9 and GCC 3.4.3\n&gt; and Matlab 7.0.0 on a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 Xeon.  I am only a Linux user,\n&gt; and not a developer, so most of the error messages appear mysterious\n&gt; to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Following the instructions, I downloaded Cantera and compiled and\n&gt; installed it on July 6.  I ran the self-test at that time.  Now I wish\n&gt; to test the Matlab part of Cantera.  So I navigate in Matlab to\n&gt; ~/cantera-1.6.0/Cantera/matlab/cantera/examples.  Then I open the file\n&gt; run_examples.m in that subdirectory, and attempt to run it in the\n&gt; Matlab interpreter.  I get the error message pasted to the end of this\n&gt; post.  The problem appears related to the version of GCC used to\n&gt; compile (?) and obtain the ctmethods.mexglx file.  I searched the\n&gt; archives of this user group for the string &quot;GCC&quot; and I noticed a\n&gt; thread begun by Michele V. who also had a problem with this file, but\n&gt; her problem appears to differ from mine in the details.  In my case,\n&gt; the file exists on the disk in the location specified and has a file\n&gt; size of 2581107 bytes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone have any insight into or prior experience with this problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ananda Himansu\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Unable to load mex file:\n&gt; /ODIN_local_backup/fshiman/cantera-1.6.0/Cantera/matlab/cantera/ \n&gt; ctmethods.mexglx.\n&gt; /r/workstations/products/matlab/matlab7.1/bin/glnx86/../../sys/os/ \n&gt; glnx86/libgcc_s.so.1:\n&gt; version `GCC_3.3&#39; not found (required by /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6)\n&gt; ???
