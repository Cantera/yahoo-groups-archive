I have attempted to install version 1.4\nfor Unix, and so far I have not gotten through the &quot;make install&quot; step.  I\nhave spent some time following the paths of compilation, and I believe I&#39;m\nmaking progress, but I thought you might have a simple suggestion of how to\nget Cantera up and running.  The problem seems to be that the necessary\nfiles are not present in the correct directories, or the correct compiler is\nnot being used - I&#39;m not entirely sure, but trying to compile each small\nfile individually does not seem efficient.  I appreciate any advice you can\ngive, but I will keep working on it as is.  Also, I just wanted to let you\nknow that we are very excited to work with Cantera.\n\nThanks,\n\nSarah Warthesen\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: dggoodwin [mailto:dgoodwin@...]\nSent: Friday, February 15, 2002 11:00 AM\nTo: cantera@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [cantera] progress report\n\n\n\nSometimes I wonder what I&#39;ve gotten myself into with Cantera... it\nturns out (big surprise) that developing a large software project is\nA Big Job. Particularly when one has a day job...\n\nAnyway, significant progress is being made, although it may not seem\nlike it (to anyone but me). In particular, the first really-useful\nCantera application is almost ready - a one dimensional reacting-flow\napplication, that can be used to simulate:\n\n- 1D laminar flames\n- counterflow flames\n- stagnation-point flows with surface chemistry (CVD, catalysis, etc.)\n\nI expect it will be ready to ship in a couple of weeks... stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncantera-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
