So, I am now able to use the &quot;clear all&quot; and\n&gt; the &quot;cleanup&quot; commands either at the end of each loop, or right\n&gt; before\n&gt; equilibrate.  However, this did not improve the memory problem at\n&gt; all!  With all variables and C++ Cantera objects deleted, shouldn&#39;t\n&gt; equilibrate run just as if it were by its self, and not in a\n&gt; complicated loop?  After about 5-10 temperature increments,\n&gt; equilibrate still crashes Matlab, and I have to exit and restart the\n&gt; program in order to do anything.  Do you have any suggestions?  How\n&gt; much better is Python at memory management?  Would it be worth\n&gt; switching to Python?\n&gt; Thank you very much for any help you can offer.\n&gt; Jeff Miller\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
