I recently noticed that when I get the\n&gt; thermal diffusion coefficients for GRI30 mech from MATLAB and compare\n&gt; it with the results obtained by running my C++ program, some of the\n&gt; values have opposite signs (i.e, +ve valued in one and -ve in the\n&gt; other). I cross checked this by running the transport 2 example in\n&gt; c++ for a temperature of 2000 K and gave the same input in MATLAB. I\n&gt; had 4 values that were inconsistent. What is to be done when such a\n&gt; situation props up?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Niveditha\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
