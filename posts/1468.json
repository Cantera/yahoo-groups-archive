It&#39;s \nnot &quot;big&quot; enough that I want to swi=\r\ntch to C++ because MATLAB offers \nsome nice features I don&#39;t want to miss i=\r\nn my project (GUI&#39;s, \nstandard solver, etc..). And shame on me! :) I&#39;m not =\r\nquite familiar \nwith python.\n\nNevertheless I also don&#39;t want to miss CANTER=\r\nA!! \n\nI&#39;ve tried some different &quot;clear&quot; options within MATLAB after the \nCA=\r\nNTERA calls. It&#39;s just a sort of workaround but it seems like it \nwill work=\r\n better now.\n \nDestroying the MATLAB own variables can be done easily with =\r\n&quot;clear \nall&quot;. \n\n&gt;&gt;inmem\nreveals the functions loaded. With &quot;clear functions=\r\n&quot; one can free at \nleast this memory. (&quot;cleanup&quot; doesn&#39;t do that). This wil=\r\nl lower the \nperformance of course.\n\nAlso think of any globals! They are no=\r\nt destroyed with &quot;clear all&quot; in \nevery workspace.\n\n\nThanks again!  \n\nTom\n\n-=\r\n-- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do=\r\nes anybody know how to load and unload cantera related &quot;stuff&quot;\n&gt; &gt; within s=\r\nubfunctions of big MATLAB codes in a definte way?\n&gt; \n&gt; MATLAB has a number =\r\nof limitations as a front end for Cantera, or \nany  \n&gt; C++ code.  The bigge=\r\nst problem is that it does not provide a good \nway  \n&gt; to manage memory all=\r\nocation for cases where the MATLAB code calls \nC  \n&gt; or C++ code that alloc=\r\nates some memory.  MATLAB does not provide  \n&gt; &quot;destructors&quot; for classes, s=\r\no when an object created by a call to  \n&gt; &quot;GRI30&quot;, for example, is deleted,=\r\n only the MATLAB variables are  \n&gt; released, not any memory allocated by Ca=\r\nntera.\n&gt; This is a fundamental limitation of the object model used in \nMATL=\r\nAB,  \n&gt; unlike the much more robust object model of Python.\n&gt; \n&gt; I always g=\r\net a bit nervous when I hear people describing &quot;big&quot;  \n&gt; calculations done =\r\nusing Cantera and MATLAB.  My recommendation \nwould  \n&gt; be to switch to Pyt=\r\nhon, or even go all the way to C++...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; p.s.: just a tip:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve re=\r\ncognized a &quot;pointer like&quot; behaviour of solution variables \nin\n&gt; &gt; MATLAB.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; if you do something like:\n&gt; &gt; g1=3DGRI30;\n&gt; &gt; g2=3Dg1;\n&gt; &gt; set(g1,&#39;T&#39;,40=\r\n0);\n&gt; &gt; The set command will have effect on BOTH variables g1 and g2!!!!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; The MATLAB objects just store pointers to the underlying C++ \nobjects; =\r\n \n&gt; the statement &quot;g2=3Dg1&quot; copies the pointer. If you want a new,  \n&gt; inde=\r\npendent object, you have to call a constructor. So you would \nneed  \n&gt; to w=\r\nrite:\n&gt; g1=3DGRI30;\n&gt; g2=3DGRI30;\n&gt; instead of assigning g1 to g2.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
