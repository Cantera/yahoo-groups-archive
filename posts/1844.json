I\nadopted the m=\r\natlab example (diffflame.m) with a few changes, and\nslowly increase the mas=\r\ns flow rates until the flame extinguishes.\nHowever, the flame does not exti=\r\nnguish! I stopped the simulation at a\nglobal strain rate (based on inlet ve=\r\nlocities and densities) of over\n2000 1/s and inlet velocities higher than 5=\r\n0m/s...\n\nRelated to this:\n-The highest temperature is about 3000K. Isn&#39;t th=\r\nis a bit too high?\n-When I load the solution of the last flame (as a starti=\r\nng guess for\nthe new flame with higher inlet mass rates), I get thousands o=\r\nf\nwarnings that massFractions are below zero (they are -1e-15 or\nsmaller). =\r\nShould I be concerned about this?\n\nThank you for your help,\nSebastian\n\n\n"}}
