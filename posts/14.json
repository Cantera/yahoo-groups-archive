If you are having problems with something, \nit\n&gt; &gt;is likely someone else is too. I get an e-mail message from Yahoo \nas\n&gt; &gt;soon as any message is posted, so my reply will be no slower than \nif\n&gt; &gt;you e-mail me directly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m interested in hearing the comments of anyone who has tried to\n&gt; &gt;download, install, and use Cantera. Have you tried the Python\n&gt; &gt;interface? Or CtLib? How did they work? etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A final note: much of the Cantera web site will be down tomorrow\n&gt; &gt;morning due to a necessary power shutdown in the building housing \nthe\n&gt; &gt;host machines.
