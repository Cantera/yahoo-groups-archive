I am using Cantera  \n from within Matlab, where I solve systems of compressors and turbines.  It  \nworks great most of the time!  However when my code asks Cantera to  \nsetState_SP (entropy and Pressure) or set_State_HP and this state fall  \nsufficiently close to 1000K, Cantera crashes.  I know I could fudge my  \nquarry in the hopes I donâ€™t land on a 1000K condition but I would rather  \nknow my code (and Cantera) are rock stable.\n\nI believe this is happening because of the NASA polynomials switching  \ncoefficients at 1000K, and while the polynomials are close to each other,  \nthe setState function requires 10^-8 accuracy (way more than I require).\n\nI am hoping someone else has solved this problem or can offer assistance.   \nMy current thought is to find the function(s) where the polynomial  \ncoefficients are chosen for the appropriate temperature range.   Then add  \na case such that between T = 999 and 1001 a new polynomial will be  \ninterpolated and used for the subsequent thermo calculations.   \nUnfortunately I have yet to find which functions these are and deduce if  \nthis may really work/help?\n\nYour help will be greatly appreciated,\nWinston Burbank\nftwsb@...\n\n"}}
