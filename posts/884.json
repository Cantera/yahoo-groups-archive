I used it the \nlast time with Matlab 6, one year ago...and it still worked \nproperly.  I try to re-use it but I always get the following error \nmessage:\n\nUnable to load mex file: C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;Barbara \nPesenti&#92;Mes documents&#92;Utils&#92;Utilitaires \nPphys&#92;Cantera&#92;Cantera_Matlab&#92;cantera-mlab-10\n&#92;cantera&#92;@Phase&#92;private&#92;newphase.dll.\n\nI tried to change the path, to move the files, to work in the \ndirectory where the files are,... but noting works.\n\nDoes anyone still use this old version somewhere and can advise me?  \n\nIf not, I&#39;d like to know how to use the latest release of Cantera in \nMatlab.  I have downloaded and installed the new toolbox in \n&#92;Cantera&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera, but it appearently needs Python to \nrun inside Matlab.  Python was not necessary with the older version \nof the matlab routines and I am therefore a little bit confused with \nthe new release (I&#39;m really not familiar with Python).  Could you \nplease tell me how I should proceed to make the latest Cantera \nToolbox run into Matlab (6 or 7)?\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who can help,\n\nRegards,\n\nBarbara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
