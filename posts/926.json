I set the supply T,P,X and keep the \npressure constant with a flexible wall (K=10^9).  Then I made a loop \nto update the volume until it matches a specific residence time in \nthe reactor:\n            while dtres&gt;tres/100:\n##                n=n+1\n##                print n\n                R=Reactor(gas,volume=vol)\n                IN=MassFlowController(S,R,mdot=0.3)\n                OUT=MassFlowController(R,E,mdot=0.3)\n                Xfer=Wall(R,E,K=10^9)\n                RN=ReactorNet([S,R,E])\n                RN.advance(10000)\n                tres_calc=gas.density()*R.volume()/.3\n                dtres=abs(tres_calc-tres)\n                vol=.3/gas.density()*tres\n            print gas.temperature(),gas.pressure(),gas.moleFraction\n(&#39;NO&#39;),gas.moleFraction(&#39;CO&#39;),gas.moleFraction(&#39;CH4&#39;),gas.moleFraction\n(&#39;CO2&#39;)\n\nThen I compare this value to the equilibrium value (I&#39;ve tried \nsolver=1,2,3 and different tolerances... they all produce an answer \nwithint the tolerance)  \n\nThe mole fractions that come out of the reactor model never reaches \nor approaches the value given by the equilibrium calculation.  Also, \nand more importantly, there is a jump in the concentrations and \ntemperature of the reactor at approximately 1 second. The jump \nsignificant for all of the values I have been keeping track of, and \norders of magnitude for NO and CO.\n\nI can understand why the reactor model as I have it set up may be \ndifferent from the equilibrate, but why is there a jump in TPX around \n1 second of residence time in the reactor?  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve \ndescribed my situation completely, if you like I can send you the \npython script and excel plots.  Thanks\n\nScott \n\n\n\n\n"}}
