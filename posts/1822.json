Does anyone know how I can get the pre-exponential frequency=\r\n \nfactor (A), pre-temperature index (n) and the activation energy of a \nrea=\r\nction (Ea)?\n\nIn chemkin format, a reversable reaction has an equilibrium co=\r\nnstant \nexplicitly written just after the reaction string. In cti format, i=\r\nt \nlooks like only the forward rate data are written. It does seem the \nrev=\r\nerse rates are also considered. My question is how does the code \nknow the =\r\nequilibrium constant or the reverse rate data?\n\nWill appreciate any ideas o=\r\nn these questions.\n\nRegards,\nBen Akih.\n\n\n"}}
