I tried starting with the python interface\nusing a Stagnati=\r\nonFlow object\n\n  sim =3D StagnationFlow(gas =3D gas, grid =3D initial_grid)=\r\n \n\nI can set the inflow boundary conditions via \n  sim.inlet.set(mdot =3D m=\r\ndot, T =3D tinlet, X =3D comp1)\nHowever, I have no idea how I can set prope=\r\nr boundary conditions\nfor the inert stagnation surface. I studied Stagnatio=\r\nnFlow.py\nbut I cannot find any member function to, e.g., set boundary\ncondi=\r\ntions for temperature and composition (fixed value or zero\ngradient). How c=\r\nan I set/prescribe those values? Or does anyone\nhas already a script doing =\r\nthis problem (catcomb.py is not\nexactly what I want as it has surface chemi=\r\nstry. However, I am\ntrying to adopt it for my purpose but failed so far).\n\n=\r\n\nThanks for help\n\nMichael Oevermann\n\n\n"}}
