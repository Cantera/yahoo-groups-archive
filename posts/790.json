I suppose you&#39;re\ndecreasing\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; enthalpy by calling &#39;setState_HP&#39; first with the desired enthalpy\n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; pressure and initial composition.  I bet the problem is that the \n&gt; &gt; resulting initial temperature is so low that it is either out of\n&gt; range \n&gt; &gt; for the thermo data, or causes numerical problems for other\nreasons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you run the problem fixing (T,P) rather than (H,P)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You might also try the new equilibrium solver, which doesn&#39;t use \n&gt; &gt; ChemEquil.  In Python, you can access it by creating a &#39;Mixture&#39; \n&gt; &gt; containing the gas phase:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; gas = GRI30()\n&gt; &gt; mix = Mixture([(gas, 1.0)])\n&gt; &gt; mix.equilibrate(&#39;HP&#39;)\n&gt; &gt; print mix\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And if you want to include a condensed phase, you can do it like\n&gt; this:\n&gt; &gt; gas = GRI30()\n&gt; &gt; carbon = importPhase(&#39;graphite.cti&#39;)\n&gt; &gt; mix = Mixture([(gas, 1.0), (carbon, 0.0)])\n&gt; &gt; mix.equilibrate(&#39;HP&#39;)\n&gt; &gt; print mix\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Depending on the version of Cantera you have this may or may not\n&gt; work.  \n&gt; &gt; It definitely works with the prerelease of version 1.6, available\n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; CVS.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dave\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Apr 29, 2005, at 11:05 AM, jcs6a50 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone had trouble getting ChemEquil to behave?
