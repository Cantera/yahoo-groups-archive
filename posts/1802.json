I will describe the  \nsolution, then my symptoms.  However, this solution was found not by  \nmyself, but with the help of a mac guru, so I will most likely not be  \nthe best to ask for further detailed questions.\n\nThe Solution to &quot;needing to set environment variable PYTHON_CMD&quot;\nMy solution was to create a new directory ~/.MacOSX and to create  \nenvironment.plist (see websites: http://www.astro.washington.edu/owen/AquaEnvVar.html \n  and http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html)\nMy working environment.plist file looks as follows.\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &quot;-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd \n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;plist version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;dict&gt;\n         &lt;key&gt;PYTHON_CMD&lt;/key&gt;\n         &lt;string&gt;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/ \nbin/python&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;\n\nAfter Restarting my OS/computer everything seems to work as it should!\n\nMy SYMPTOMS:\nMy case goes as follows: I had OS X 10.4 Tiger, I installed python,  \nnumarray, sundials, matlab, cantera and everything worked great!  I  \nthen upgraded to OS X 10.5 Leopard; everything worked great!  I then  \nupgraded Python and everything went to hell.  From the python shell  \nand Matlab I got errors such as ctm2ct error set PYTHON_CMD (not exact  \nerror, but close).\nEven after several reinstalls, I got the same errors, and after being  \nreminded to run the python setup.py scripts, same errors.\n\nUpon further investigation, typing env into the terminal I saw that  \nPATH was set to cantera but no PYTHON_CMD.  I then opened the  \nsetup_cantera file into textedit, and pasted the commands into the  \nterminal.  Typing env again showed PYTHON_CMD was set, but I still got  \nthe same errors.\nOddly and very repeatedly, if I closed that terminal and immediately  \nor any other time after opened a new terminal window and typed env  \nagain PYTHON_CMD was absent.\n\nMy Linux savy friend then suggested modifying the bash-profile (not  \nexactly sure) to add the environment variable.  Now any new terminal  \nwindow would always show PYTHON_CMD as set.  However we read in the  \nbash-profile script that this was for interactive windows only, and  \nhence when demos where run from python shell or Matlab I still  \nreceived the same errors.\nWe then tried the bash-rc file (still not exactly sure), restarted and  \nnothing new happened.\nAdditionally we discovered from the terminal if we ran a demo such as  \npython equilibrium.py, it ran!  But starting the demo from IDLE and  \nselecting Run -&gt; Run Module, opened a python shell and returned the  \nsame errors as above, need to set PYTHON_CMD.\n\nI now met with the mac guru, and upon investigating everything  \ndescribed above, and reading the two linked websites (same as above: http://www.astro.washington.edu/owen/AquaEnvVar.html \n  and http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html)\nhe then tried the above solution, restarted and... Everything now  \nseems to work as it should!! The Python shell and Matlab!\n\nWell I thought it is important to contribute back and I am sorry I do  \nnot understand my problem well enough to keep others from having the  \nsame problem, but at least now they have a better starting off point  \nto find a solution.\n\nWinston Burbank\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\n"}}
