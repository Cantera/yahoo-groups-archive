I added that option in preconfig file, =\r\n\n&gt; and that took care of quite a few errors I was getting. I feel \n&gt; that t=\r\nhe current message might have to do with similar changes to \n&gt; the make fil=\r\nes for the sundials package. But, I&#39;m not sure and in \n&gt; any case, I&#39;m not =\r\nsure where to make the changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d appreciate your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhupinder\n\n\n\n\n"}}
