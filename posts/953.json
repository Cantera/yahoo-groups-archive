I tried modelling the fuel as CH4:0.9, \nCH3:0.1, H:0.1 to begin a reaction. But I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a \nbetter approach for this.\n\nIn the case of my interest, my initial composition consists of a \nmixture of air and fuel diluted by exhaust gases (an over \nsimplified case of exhaust gas recirculation). From some \ncalculations, I set the initial composition of gases. But since \nthe mixture is very dilute, the reaction does not take off even \nwith CH4:0.9, CH3:0.1, H:0.1 and hence I had to raise the initial \ntemperature. I had to put a temperature as high as 1800 to start \nthe reaction and to my surprise, that initial temperature value \ndoesn&#39;t even show up on the plots! I tried changing the time scale \nto make sure that what I first saw was actually true.\n\nI couldn&#39;t quite comprehend where I was going wrong.\n\nAlso, my next step would be to run a continuously stirred reactor \nmodel for recirculated flows. I&#39;m wondering, if there&#39;s a way to \nsend a temperature pulse for initiating reaction. There&#39;s a \n&quot;Gaussian&quot; function in a python example. But, it did not send a \ntemperature pulse. Instead the ignitor was modelled as a reservoir \nof H atoms.\n\nThanks,\n\nBhupinder\n\n--\nBhupinder Singh\nDepartment of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering\nUniversity of Florida\nGainesville\n\nPh: 352-392-4442 (O)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
