Undefined function or variable &#39;catcomb&#39;.\n\nAlso, do the regular functions from the toolbox work?  (probably the\nsimplest to check is &#39;gasconstant.m&#39;--just type &#39;gasconstant&#39;\n[without the single quotes] and press enter).  If so, this would\nalmost certainly point to a problem in the matlab path.\n\nGood luck,\nSteven DeCaluwe\n\n\n--- csmnofbobs &lt;jemiller@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I followed the directions when setting the paths in Matlab.

The directions I\n&gt; \n&gt; followed said that Matlab 6.x might work, but that the\n&gt; Matlab-Python \n&gt; interface was designed for 7.0.  \n&gt; Thank you everyone for the help.\n&gt; -Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
