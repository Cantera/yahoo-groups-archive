If you are writing C++/Fortran code, you should be \ncompiling Cantera from the source anyway, so it seems there is no point \nin putting these .lib files in the binary installer, and it \nsignificantly reduces the size of the installer (from ~6 Mb to ~1 Mb).\n\nMostly this release contains only minor changes. But I recommend that \nyou upgrade anyway (if you are installing Cantera from the .msi file \nand not building it yourself from source code), particularly if you are \nusing Cantera from MATLAB.\n\nNew features:\n\n- support for non-integral reactant and product stoichiometric \ncoefficients for irreversible reactions.\n\n- ck2cti now can parse Chemkin-format reaction mechanisms that contain \nthe extensions used in the MIT soot mechanism to specify very large \nmolecules in the THERMO section records.\n\n\nBug fix:\n\n- A minor bug has been fixed that suppressed Cantera diagnostic \nmessages during flame simulations from MATLAB under Windows.  Now you \nwill see the progress of the calculation as it runs.\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nIn the Python demos, the equilibrium example &#39;multiphase_plasma.cti&#39; \nfails to converge at low temperature (350 K), although it works fine on \nMac/linux platforms. If works if you set the initial temperature to 400 \nK.\n\nIn the MATLAB demos, &#39;catcomb.m&#39; reports &#39;time integration failed.&#39;  \nAgain, this works fine on Mac/linux.\n\nProbably both of these just need some fine tuning to run on Windows.  I \nbelieve all of the other demos run.\n\n\n====================\n\nNote to &quot;Windows power users&quot;:\nI have also updated CVS, and now you will find in the Cantera solution \nin Visual C++ a new project &quot;SetupCanteraLite&quot;.  This builds an \ninstaller that skips packaging the static libraries.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
