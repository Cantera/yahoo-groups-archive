I=\r\n was able to \nsuccessfully install everything starting from CVS and using g=\r\ncc4 but then when testing \nCantera in Matlab 7.1, I get:\n\n???

On the MathWorks web site they have \n&gt;=\r\n information about the compiler versions for various operating systems.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The problem may be related to changes in libstdc++ in gcc 4.x compared \n&gt;=\r\n to gcc 3.x. As I understand it, libstdc++ in gcc 4 is a shared library, \n&gt;=\r\n while in gcc 3 it was a static library. There are probably other \n&gt; incomp=\r\natibilities between the two versions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some linux systems maintain more=\r\n than one version of the gcc compilers. \n&gt;   You may be able to specify whi=\r\nch one to use in the Cantera &#39;configure&#39; \n&gt; script, to match the one requir=\r\ned by MATLAB.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be of more help, but currently I do no=\r\nt have access \n&gt; to a linux machine that has MATLAB installed, so I can&#39;t d=\r\niagnose the \n&gt; problem myself.  Has anyone else encountered and solved this=\r\n problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 17, 2005, at 11:51 AM, chrtom1979 wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Mr Goodwin,\n&gt; &gt; I have successfully installed Cantera 1.6 u=\r\nnder Suse Linux 10.0, but I\n&gt; &gt; still have problems using matlab interface,=\r\n related to the version of\n&gt; &gt; GCC installed.
