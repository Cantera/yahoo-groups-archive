This will give you 40 separate fixed-composition  \nliquid phases. What you want is a single liquid phase solution of 40  \nspecies. Harry Moffat has added classes for liquid solutions to  \nCantera, so he is probably the best one to answer this.  But  \nunfortunately the hooks to access these classes from Python or MATLAB  \nhave not been implemented yet, so you are likely to need to work in C+ \n+ to use these...\n\n\nOn Jan 25, 2007, at 10:44 AM, chitral_naik wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to solve three phase equilibrium at 1 atm and 350K.
