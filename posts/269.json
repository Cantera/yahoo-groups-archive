Just downloaded it and tried the demos,\n&gt; when I found an execution error. It seems that Matlab R13 (6.5) has a\n&gt; built-in &#39;surface&#39; function and so there is a name conflict with the\n&gt; Cantare toolbox.\n&gt; I wanted to (1) report it, because I don&#39;t know if someone else did\n&gt; it, and (2) know if there is a newer version of the toolbox with the\n&gt; name of this particular function changed (and all the references of\n&gt; it in other files).\n&gt; I could just change the names myself and send back the toolbox code\n&gt; with the changes, but I guess the maintainer(s) of the code would\n&gt; like to choose the new name of the function.\n&gt; Thank you the great job done in Cantera.\n&gt;\n&gt; Marcus Vinicius\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
