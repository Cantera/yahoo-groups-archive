From what I understand\nCantera uses the same data as GRI-Mech 3.0 for these calculations,\ncorrect? If so it uses a seven digit polynomial fit of molar heat\ncapacity, entropy and standard enthalpy of formation values and it\nuses this fit to find values in the temperature range 200K-3000K, correct?\n \nMy problem is that I need a code that can calculate (in the cases\nwhere data exists) up to 20000K, or even higher if possible. I know\nthat this is possible to do with CEA but it would save me a lot of\nwork if I could do it with a program that is Matlab compatible (such\nas Cantera). Is it at all possible?\n\nThanks,\n           Tomas\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
