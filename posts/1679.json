The pressure regulator device states which \ndirection =\r\nthe flow will be. So having two pressure regulators, each \nwith flow in the=\r\n opposite direction, between two reactors would achieve \npressure equilibri=\r\num by means of mass transfer. It this approach \npossible, when these two re=\r\nactors are in the reactor network outlined \nabove (with vdot applied).\n\nThe=\r\n question arises because, at some time t, the pressure in reactor 1 \nwould =\r\nbe higher than reactor 2, therefore mass flow would be to reactor \n2, but l=\r\nater, at time t2, when reactor 2 has a higher pressure than \nreactor 1, the=\r\n mass could not flow back into reactor 1, therefore \npressure equilibrium w=\r\nould not be achieved, if only one pressure \nregulator were applied.\n\nHoping=\r\n someone has some experience of such area&#39;s.\n\nMany thanks in advance of cou=\r\nrse,\n\nAdam.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
