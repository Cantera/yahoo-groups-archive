Now we need to decide whether to do it or not.\n&gt; I&#39;d like to get some sense of how useful people feel a Cantera  \n&gt; workshop\n&gt; would be, and how many might attend if it were held in Heidelberg on\n&gt; Sunday, August 6.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we do it, I would like much of the workshop to consist of\n&gt; contributed talks from Cantera users on what you are doing with  \n&gt; Cantera\n&gt; in research or teaching.  But of course I could talk about future\n&gt; directions for Cantera (or whatever else people are interested in)  \n&gt; too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another option would be to hold a workshop somewhere else.  This might\n&gt; be preferred by non-combustion Cantera users, who wouldn&#39;t be in\n&gt; Heidelberg. (There&#39;s always the &quot;Westin La Cantera&quot; golf resort near\n&gt; San Antonio, Texas...)\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me know what you think, either by posting to the user&#39;s group, or\n&gt; by sending me an email message.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
