I have\nsuccessfully linked Cantera&#39;s libraries against m=\r\ny own to provide my\nmodel with local species densities, given the local tem=\r\nperature,\npressure and elemental composition. Unfortunately, only the algor=\r\nithm\nused for the multiphase equilibrium proved stable enough. This\nalgorit=\r\nhm has the drawback of being far slower than the one used in\nthe singlephas=\r\ne code. After my collegue did some profiling, however,\nwe discovered that a=\r\n lot of time is spent on generating log messages\n(in my particular case up =\r\nto 60% of the total time). If the loglevel\nis set to -1 this information is=\r\n discarded. Is there some way to look\nat the loglevel before calling Multip=\r\nhaseEquil::PrintInfo() ?  Just\ncommenting out the call to printInfo() alrea=\r\ndy speeds up the\ncalculation by a factor two.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nMark Beks\n\nP.S. o=\r\nn an unrelated issue: is there some way to create dynamic\nlibraries instead=\r\n of static libraries? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
