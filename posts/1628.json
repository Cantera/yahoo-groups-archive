It is probably best to check out a fresh working copy, rather  \nthan update an existing one. The new features are:\n\n1. Thread safe build option.  Cantera can optionally be built to be  \nthread safe, which insures that static data (e.g. cached error  \nmessages) are modified by only one thread at a time. This option  \nrequires the Boost thread library (which is why it is not the  \ndefault).  You can download Boost from www.boost.org.\n\n2. Faster chemical equilibrium. The equilibrium routines were  \nspending quite a bit of time writing detailed logfiles. Now this can  \nbe turned off, or completely compiled out of the code.\n\nBoth of these options may be set in the preconfig script. Please  \nreport any build problems with this new version.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
