The fuel is CH4, CO, N2 \nand H2O mixture. T=\r\nhe initial temperature is 1373K. But the result \nseems to be crazy. The adi=\r\nabatic temperature is over 2500K and the \nflame speed is 6 m/s. That&#39;s impo=\r\nssible I think. So there should be \nsomething wrong in the code that I have=\r\n not found. Please help me.\n\nI change the initial temperature by these:\n\n  =\r\n  doublereal temp =3D 1373.0; // K\n    doublereal pressure =3D 1.0*OneAtm; =\r\n//atm\n    doublereal uin=3D0.3; //m/sec\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    flame.setFixe=\r\ndTemperature(1400.0);\n\nI think maybe I should change uin here. But nothing =\r\nchanges after \ndoing so. What&#39;s the problem?\n\nThank you very much!!!\n\n\n"}}
