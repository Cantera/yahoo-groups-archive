At the beginning of the second reactor, the &#39;set&#39; \ncommand can be used to match the inlet of reactor 2 with the outlet \nof reactor 1. All of the variables passed are numerical values and \nmay solve Brooks&#39; problem described below. However, this assumes that \nthe same mechanism is used in both reactors.\n\nIs there a more efficient and robust method of tracking the chemistry \nand thermodynamics throughout a Simulink system?\n\nThanks -\n\nJosh\n\n&gt; Our research group has recently been trying to integrate Cantera \n&gt; calculations into some Matlab Simulink models, and it looks like   \n&gt; it&#39;s a somewhat difficult process to get the two of them to work   \n&gt; together in such a way as to be able to pass around mixture objects \n&gt; via Simulink links.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I understand it, the primary problem appears to be that Simulink \n&gt; wants to only handle numbers and arrays of numbers; it doesn&#39;t (as\n&gt; far as we can find) have a capacity to pass objects.  I expect the \n&gt; solution would be some form of creating a Cantera mixture object\n&gt; (i.e. &quot;heavyweight&quot; reaction-mechanism object, as per earlier \n&gt; discussion of copying objects to track multiple states), extracting \n&gt; the pointer to this object in a form that Simulink can treat as a \n&gt; number, combining it with the numerical state information to make a \n&gt; &quot;plain&quot; vector representation that Simulink can pass around, and   \n&gt; then reconstructing the relevant mixture objects from this within  \n&gt; each Simulink block.  This seems like a rather complicated wheel to \n&gt; reinvent if someone&#39;s already done it, though, particularly if     \n&gt; there are complications to it that I haven&#39;t forseen!\n&gt; \n&gt; So: Has anyone on the list done this (or something similar)        \n&gt; already, and if so can you offer some advice and perhaps examples  \n&gt; of how to make this work?  Does the potential solution that I have \n&gt; seem like it&#39;s on the right track, and are there any nonobvious    \n&gt; pitfalls I should look out for?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks much,\n&gt; - Brooks\n\n\n\n"}}
