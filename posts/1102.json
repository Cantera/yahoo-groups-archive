The python installation is /usr/local/bin/python=\r\n.  There is no\n&quot;python2&quot; installation.   However, the config/configure scri=\r\npt always\ntries to &quot;preset&quot; the python command to &quot;/usr/bin/python2&quot; - whic=\r\nh\ndoes not exist.  I have modified the config/configure file to\nhard-code t=\r\nhis to PYTHON_CMD=3Dpython, and that works.  However, this is\nnot an ideal =\r\nsolution.  I have also tried specifying\nPYTHON_CMD:=3D&quot;/usr/local/bin/pytho=\r\nn&quot; in the configure file (in the base\ndirectory).  This does not work.\n\n2. =\r\nI have &quot;install&quot; available as /usr/sbin/install and /etc/install. \nCantera =\r\nignores these and instead tries to use the config/install-sh,\nbut the paths=\r\n to this that get generated in the makefiles as well as\nthe bin/install_tsc=\r\n file are all wrong.  The only work-around I have\nfound for that is to crea=\r\nte soft-links to config/install-sh in several\nplaces.  This is also not a g=\r\nood solution.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nI haven&#39;t had problems installing on linux=\r\n...\n\nThanks,\n\nJames\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
