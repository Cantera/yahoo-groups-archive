Just downloaded it and tried the demos, \nwhen I found an execution error. It seems that Matlab R13 (6.5) has a \nbuilt-in &#39;surface&#39; function and so there is a name conflict with the \nCantare toolbox.\nI wanted to (1) report it, because I don&#39;t know if someone else did \nit, and (2) know if there is a newer version of the toolbox with the \nname of this particular function changed (and all the references of \nit in other files).\nI could just change the names myself and send back the toolbox code \nwith the changes, but I guess the maintainer(s) of the code would \nlike to choose the new name of the function.\nThank you the great job done in Cantera.\n\nMarcus Vinicius\n\n\n\n"}}
