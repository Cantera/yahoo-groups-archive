Collision efficiencies are specified in strings \nlike this:\n\n          efficiencies = &quot; AR:0.7  C2H6:3  CH4:2  CO:1.5  CO2:2  H2:2  \nH2O:6 &quot;\n\nUnfortunately, in the code that parses the &lt;name&gt;:&lt;value&gt; pairs, the \nstring representing the numerical value for each species was being \ntruncated to a length equal to the number of species in the list.  In \nthis example, there is no problem, since there are 7 species listed, an \nall of the values have less than 7 characters. On the other hand, a \nspecification like\n\n          efficiencies = &quot; AR:0.83  H2:2.4  H2O:15.4 &quot;\n\nhas problems, since there are only 3 species but two of the value \nstrings have four characters.  The efficiencies will be read in as if \nthe string were &quot;AR:0.8 H2:2.4 H2O:15.&quot;\n\nThis problem DOES NOT affect GRI-Mech 3.0 (gri30.cti or gri30.xml), but \ndoes affect h2o2.cti.  Other mechanisms not included with Cantera may \nor may not be affected - you should check any mechanisms you use.\n\nThis problem has been fixed in the CVS repository on the \nPrerelease_1_6_0_branch branch.  If you are compiling from the source \ncode (whatever version you have), you can fix it yourself. Open file \nCantera/src/ctml.cpp, and in function &quot;getPairs&quot; at line 384, change \n&quot;v.size()&quot; to  &quot;v[i].size()&quot;. That is, change the line\n\n             val.push_back(v[i].substr(icolon+1, v.size()));\n\nto read\n\n             val.push_back(v[i].substr(icolon+1, v[i].size()));\n\nand recompile/install.\n\nIf you are using Cantera from a binary installation, a work-around is \nto simply make sure that the efficiencies string has enough entries to \navoid the truncation problem.  For example, adding one more species \n(with value set to the default of 1.0) fixes the problem in the second \nstring above:\n\n          efficiencies = &quot; AR:0.83  H2:2.4  H2O:15.4 H:1&quot;\n\n\nI am sorry this problem was not caught much earlier, and hope it hasn&#39;t \ncaused too many problems.  It affects the flame1 demo, which uses \nh2o2.cti, but does not affect the flame2 demo, which uses gri30.cti. \nThe changes in the solution for flame1 are minor, but the peak \ntemperature changes by a couple of degrees.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
