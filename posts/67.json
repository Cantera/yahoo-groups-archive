In \nwhich C++ file (please give the file name) the solver was called?\n\n2: Did you compare the results coming out from cantera with those \nfrom CHEMKIN III? Or what do you think to use different ODE solvers?\nCan we expect the same y vs. t? Indeed when I used MATLAB&#39;s ODE15S to \nsolve the same problem shown in SENKIN as a example,(20 reaction, 9 \nspecies), I got silent different y vs. t?\n\n3: Since k=k(t,T) and T=T(t), it is difficult to solve large sparse \nDAEs. In my own opinion, (^-^), it is not well known that CHEMKIN III \nadopt the method of infinite difference to divide the time range to \ncustom designed number of small ranges and assume the same \ntemperature within one small time range and use the previous \ncalulated T to compute k in next range. So the DAEs were changed to \nODE and easier to be solved by DASSC. Of course, it is not a prefect \nmethod. Can you tell us something about how to handle this kind of \nproblem?\n\nThank you!\n\nPingping\n\n\n\n"}}
