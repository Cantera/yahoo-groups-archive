All I \ngot to do was put the Cantera toolbox folder at the beginning of the \nMatlab path. I always put directories of my code (or third parties&#39; \nones) at the end of the path, so I can prevent exactly the \noverloading of built-in functions or functions from Mathworks \ntoolboxes.\nSo, the problem may be solved this way. But I believe it would be \nbetter off if third parties&#39; toolboxes needed not to overload a built-\nin function, just in case a user needs both of them in his/her code.\nOf course in this case it is not likely.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nMarcus Vinicius\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Marcus,\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t run into this problem before, and have been using that \n&gt; version of Matlab.  Maybe it is an issue of setting the Matlab \npath? \n&gt; I&#39;ll look into it, and if necessary change the name.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 26, 2004, at 3:53 AM, Marcus Vinicius Eiffle Duarte wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi, folks!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am a new user of Cantera.

It seems that Matlab R13 (6.5) \nhas a\n&gt; &gt; built-in &#39;surface&#39; function and so there is a name conflict with \nthe\n&gt; &gt; Cantare toolbox.\n&gt; &gt; I wanted to (1) report it, because I don&#39;t know if someone else \ndid\n&gt; &gt; it, and (2) know if there is a newer version of the toolbox with \nthe\n&gt; &gt; name of this particular function changed (and all the references \nof\n&gt; &gt; it in other files).\n&gt; &gt; I could just change the names myself and send back the toolbox \ncode\n&gt; &gt; with the changes, but I guess the maintainer(s) of the code would\n&gt; &gt; like to choose the new name of the function.\n&gt; &gt; Thank you the great job done in Cantera.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Marcus Vinicius\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
