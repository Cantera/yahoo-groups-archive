Now we would like to keep the \nconcentration of one of the substances (Methane) constant. In other\nwords: It should not take part in the overall reaction.\n\nWhat is the easiest way to do this? Should we only take a part of the \ngas into our considerations or exists there a way to tell CANTERA \nwhich reactions are not desired?\n\nWe would be grateful for any piece of advice.\n\n          Thomas Brunner and Markus Wuethrich, ETH Zurich\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
