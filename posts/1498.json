I followed the steps in the\npresenta=\r\ntion and have now got the lib library. But i still have one\nmore problem. I=\r\n was trying to build the cxx examples project but in\nthe linking step it fa=\r\nils as it is unable to find the cvode.lib file\nand the recipes.lib file. I =\r\ntried to look for the cvode.lib file but\ncouldnt find it. Also i tried to r=\r\nun the configure script that comes\nwith the sundials package using cygwin b=\r\nut was unable to get it to\nwork. Would you have any suggestions to fix this=\r\n. Thanks in advance,\nShyam.\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bert Bell&quot; &lt;=\r\nrobert.bell@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The Cantera msi installer only includes the stu=\r\nff you need to run\nCantera\n&gt; with Python and Matlab.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; For C/C++ =\r\ndevelopment  download the Cantera 1.7 source zip and build\n&gt; Cantera.

My Cantera=\r\n installation (latest) did not produce any lib\n&gt; directory with the library=\r\n files that i need to include in the linker\n&gt; directive while building the =\r\ndemo.cpp file. (ex: cantera.lib, oneD.lib\n&gt; etc.) I have two DLL files in t=\r\nhe Cantera directory: msvcp71.dll and\n&gt; msvcr71.dll. Is there a way to buil=\r\nd the demo without the lib files. I\n&gt; thought lib files were required at li=\r\nnk time to link to the dll files.\n&gt; Has anybody faced this issue and got it=\r\n solved?\n&gt; Thanks in advance, Shyam.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
