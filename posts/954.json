I&#39;ve modelled the system in a reactor \nnet such that air and exhaust gases are mixed in the mixing \njunction. The outlet of the mixing junction goes into the \ncombustor. Combustor feeds its exhaust gases into a flow split, \nwhich splits the exhaust gases into two streams, one going into \nthe mixing junction and the other is exhausted from the tail pipe. \nThe ratio of the mass flow rates of the two streams is known as \nthe recirculation ratio.\n\nOnce I try to advance such a reactor net, the program crashes. I \nneed help with figuring out where I&#39;m going wrong.\n\nI&#39;ve attached my files below. The files also include a sketch of \nthe system I&#39;m trying to model.\n\nIn addition, there&#39;s one thing I do not understand well enough. \nThe ignitor is modelled as a reservoir for H atoms. When I ran the \nmodel for a conventional engine system, as given in the python \nexample for continuously stirred reactors, I got temperatures as \nhigh as 6500 K. I had to  change the H-atoms to CH3 to get the \ntemperatures within reasonable limits. Could I be going wrong \nsomewhere?\nIs there a means of sending a pure temperature pulse rather that \nsending an ignitor_mdot pulse. Besides, wouldn&#39;t sending a pulse \nof H atoms alter the reaction chemistry?\n\nThank you,\n\nBhupinder\n\n--\nBhupinder Singh\nDepartment of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering\nUniversity of Florida\nGainesville\n\nPh: 352-392-4442 (O)\n\r\n------=_Part_7477_1694223004.1123176635100\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=Soot.zip\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Soot.zip&quot;; filename=Soot.zip\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_Part_7477_1694223004.1123176635100--\r\n\n"}}
