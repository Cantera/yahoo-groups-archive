I have also tried to chang=\r\ne\nthe includes in the file CVodesIntegrator.cpp to what is below but\nwith n=\r\no prevail.\n\n   The (partial) problem lies in the fact that the sundials pac=\r\nkage\n(it&#39;s called ) have a totally different naming convention than what is=\r\n\nanticipated in Cantera.  The includes in the CVodesIntegrator.cpp file\nonl=\r\ny unearths part of the problem.\n\n   Further, look line 56 of the file /usr/=\r\ninclude/nvector_serial.h,\nthe include file is actually pointing at the wron=\r\ng place\n(&quot;sundials_nvector.h&quot;).  What I cannot isolate, is whether the prob=\r\nlem\nis with Cantera, cvnodes, or both.\n\n   Needless to say, I did not get a=\r\nny further, and I sincerely hope\nthat I am wrong.\n\nCheers, Ed.\n\n--- In cant=\r\nera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mlbeks1975&quot; &lt;mlbeks1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been t=\r\nrying the latest SUNDIALS release ( Release 2.2.0, March\n&gt; 2006 ) on SUSE L=\r\ninux 10.0. Some of the header files are in different\n&gt; places from the thos=\r\ne in Cantera, and some have been renamed. I already \n&gt; see an #ifdef OLD_SU=\r\nNDIALS, but it appears that some more finegrained\n&gt; version matching may be=\r\n needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; To get my version working I have patched CVodesIntegrator.cpp=\r\n so it\n&gt; now reads:\n&gt; \n&gt; // sundials includes\n&gt; #include &lt;sundials/sundials=\r\n_types.h&gt;\n&gt; #include &lt;sundials/sundials_math.h&gt;\n&gt; #include &lt;cvodes.h&gt;\n&gt; #in=\r\nclude &lt;cvodes/cvodes_dense.h&gt;\n&gt; #include &lt;cvodes/cvodes_diag.h&gt;\n&gt; #include =\r\n&lt;cvodes/cvodes_spgmr.h&gt;\n&gt; #include &lt;cvodes/cvodes_band.h&gt;\n&gt; #include &lt;nvect=\r\nor_serial.h&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone confirm this?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
