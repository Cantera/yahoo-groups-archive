Replace &quot;stoichiometric_solid&quot; with  \n&quot;pure_solid&quot; and it should work.  I had meant to change &quot;pure&quot; to  \n&quot;stoichiometric&quot; and wrote the documentation that way, but forgot to  \nmake the change in the code itself.\n\nA cti file can use any variable defined by the Cantera Python (not  \nMatlab) interface.  The name &quot;OneAtm&quot; is defined in both. When  \nprocessing a cti file, Cantera cannot access Matlab variables.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jan 30, 2004, at 8:40 AM, y2kpac wrote:\n\n&gt; Dave,\n&gt; When importing a certain surface mechanism .cti file that I wrote,\n&gt; the following error was returned to me.

Does this mean that where\n&gt; numerics are required in the .cti file, the names of variables\n&gt; previously defined/declared in the Matlab script can be used\n&gt; instead?  Should these variables be global?  How should they be\n&gt; defined or declared?  For example, is the following .cti file\n&gt; section valid?
