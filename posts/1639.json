I was thinking a=\r\nbout using the stiff ODE\n&gt; integrator in SciPy, but that requires use of Nu=\r\nmPy and might \nconflict\n&gt; with Cantera&#39;s use of Numarray.

It \nseems for me that the possibility that you are asking for, is pre=\r\nsent \nalready in Cantera (probably, with very minor changing). To perform \n=\r\nsimulation with given pressure and temperature you can use the \nReactor cla=\r\nss and put the volume expansion and heat transfer \ncoefficients to very hig=\r\nh values. It will guarantee that the pressure \nand temperature in the react=\r\nor are the same as those of the \nenvironment. What you only need to do in t=\r\nhis case is to provide \nfunctional dependences for T and P of the reservoir=\r\n. Of course, it is \nnot very effective way but in this case you should not =\r\nchange \nanything in the Reactor class. \n\nBest regards, Anatoli.\n\n\n\n"}}
