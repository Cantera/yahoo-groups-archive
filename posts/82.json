I did encounter problems reading \nsome \n&gt; mechanisms files, and comments in the newsgroup suggested that \nthese \n&gt; may now be fixed in the latest version. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, I am now trying to build the matlab interface in windows \nusing \n&gt; version 1.3.  It appears to require ct.lib in the &quot;cantera-1.3\n&#92;lib&#92;&quot; \n&gt; directory (I get this from looking at buildwin.m).   I believe I \nneed \n&gt; to build this library using the visual c++ compiler.  If this is \n&gt; correct, and since I do not have the visual c++ compiler, would it \nbe \n&gt; possible to provide the ct.lib file? Are there any other libraries \n&gt; required to build the matlab interface?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Dan Flowers\n&gt; LLNL\n\n\n"}}
