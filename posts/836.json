That will help for now, but in the near future, \nwe would like to run the equilibrium calculation on this same \nmixture, but with a combination of the gas and liquid phase.  I \nbelieve that I can create the data entries for liquid N2O and C2H6 \nwithout too much trouble, but then what command would I use to import \nthese along with the gas phase into the equilibrium calculation?  \n\nJeff Miller\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; File nasa.cti specifies many species, but does not specify any \nphase \n&gt; that uses these species.  If you want to create an ideal gas \nmixture \n&gt; using these species, you can do so by adding and &quot;ideal_gas&quot; entry \nto \n&gt; the file. See how this is done in file gri30.cti, for example.\n&gt; \n&gt; If file nasa.cti contained only gaseous species, you could simply \n&gt; import all of them into your gas mixture with an entry like this, \nwhich \n&gt; could be in some other cti file.\n&gt; \n&gt; ideal_gas(name = &quot;gas&quot;,\n&gt;                     elements = &quot;H C O N Ar&quot;,\n&gt;                     species = &quot;nasa: all&quot;,\n&gt;                     options  = &quot;skip_undeclared_elements&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; This will create a gas mixture of all species in nasa.cti that \ncontain \n&gt; only the elements H, C, O, N, and/or Ar.  Unfortunately nasa.cti \n&gt; contains condensed-phase species too, like H2O(L) and H2O(S).  So \nif \n&gt; you want to do this, you would need to first create an edited \nversion \n&gt; of nasa.cti that contains only the gaseous species. Alternatively, \nyou \n&gt; can just list explicitly every species you want to include, as is \ndone \n&gt; in gri30.cti.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as the temperature problem -- if you are using gri30.cti, \nthen \n&gt; the valid temperature range for the gas mixture is set by the \nspecies \n&gt; with the highest minimum temperature, and the one with the lowest \n&gt; maximum temperature.  Even species that have zero mole fraction or \n&gt; extremely small mole fraction are considered when determining the \nvalid \n&gt; temperature range.  In gri30.cti, the species CH3O has a maximum \n&gt; temperature of 3000 K.  If you want to do computations at higher \n&gt; temperature, you could remove this species from the phase (edit \n&gt; gri30.cti, or create a copy with a different file name) if it is \nnot \n&gt; important for what you are computing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jun 7, 2005, at 11:00 AM, csmnofbobs wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Dave,\n&gt; &gt; Sorry to keep bothering you with these simple questions.  I can \nnot\n&gt; &gt; figure out how to use data from nasa.cti without pasting the data \nI\n&gt; &gt; want into a new cti file.  Another student here using Cantera \ntold me\n&gt; &gt; that in the equil demo, all he had to do was replace gri30.cti \nwith\n&gt; &gt; nasa.cti and it worked fine.
