I have seen how this is done in Matlab, but \ncan&#39;t find the exact syntax to do it in Python.  I have tried using \nthe .init() and .restore() commands with the proper solution id&#39;s (I \nthink), but it does not work.  It looks like it loads the solution,\nbut \nit only loads the grid points.  It sets the mole fractions at each\ngrid \npoint back to zero, and converges on a solution with mdot and flame \nspeed both equal to zero.  Does anyone have any suggestions for the \ncorrect syntax to load the previous solution?  \n\nThank you very much,\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n\n"}}
