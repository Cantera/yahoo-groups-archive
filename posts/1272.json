I now get a\nslightly=\r\n different error trying to run the Matlab toolbox demos.\n\nThe error is repr=\r\noduced below, and involves not being able to convert\nthe file to CTML.  I t=\r\nried all the things mentioned at\nhttp://www.cantera.org/ref/ct2ctml_trouble=\r\n.html.  If I reproduce the\noffending command line in a shell, python makes =\r\na .xml file without\ncomplaint.  The ct2ctml.log file is empty regardless of=\r\n whether it is\nrun from matlab or the command line.\n\nThe test routines runn=\r\ning from &#39;make test&#39; are all passed.  I have\ninstalled both Cantera and mat=\r\nlab in my home directory with all files\nand directories in both packages ha=\r\nving write access.\n\nI am now trying to install the older 1.6.0 version of C=\r\nantera, but\nhave still had no luck.\n\nAny suggestions would be much apprecia=\r\nted.\n\nSean\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;??? \n\n************************************************\n              =\r\n  Cantera Error!                  \n****************************************=\r\n********\n\n\nProcedure: ct2ctml\nError:   could not convert input file to CTML=\r\n.\n Command line was: \nsleep 1; /usr/bin/python /home/sean/tmp/.cttmp1151230=\r\n349.pyw &&gt;\nct2ctml.log\n\nError in =3D=3D&gt; XML_Node.XML_Node at 11\n   x.id =\r\n=3D ctmethods(10,15,0,src); % newxml(name)\n\nError in =3D=3D&gt; Solution.Solut=\r\nion at 30\ndoc =3D XML_Node(&#39;doc&#39;,src);\n\nError in =3D=3D&gt; IdealGasMix at 39\n=\r\n       s =3D Solution(a);\n\nError in =3D=3D&gt; equil at 12\n   gas =3D IdealGas=\r\nMix(&#39;gri30.cti&#39;);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
