With that done, it will be possible to configure Cantera\nfor its ultimate destination (/usr, in this case), but actually\ninstall it someplace else (here, a sandboxed environment until it is\nmerged with the live filesystem).  I have already\nmade the necessary changes to my copy of the makefile.\n\nSince the changes are fully backward-compatible, and since they will\nmake packaging easier [or even possible] for source-based\ndistributions, would it be possible to merge the changes into the\ncurrent version of Cantera?\n\nThanks very much!\n\n-Jon Chambers\n\n\n\n"}}
