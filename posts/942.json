I have discovered it a week ago and I would like\nto congratulate all the people working on this project. \n\nI am currently testing 0D calculations with python and it is very\npleasant to work with Cantera.\n\nA little question: how can one access to the heat of formations (also\nknown as enthalpies of formation) of the different species ? I did not\nfind any answer in the different docs. I need this information to\ncalculate the time evolution of the heat release rate during my\nsimulations.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nRenan\n\n-- \nRenan HILBERT\nReNuDa Engineering Computation\nParis Cyber Village\n101-103, Boulevard MacDonald - 75019 Paris\nmail : renan.hilbert@...\nweb  : www.renuda.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
