The same is true in Python.\nThe easiest way to create two independent versions of any Cantera  \nobject is to construct each one independently, for example:\n\ng = air;\nh = air;\n\nThis seems to me to be just about as easy as writing &#39;h = g,&#39; so I  \nwonder if implementing a &#39;deep&#39; copy operation is really worth it.  \nComments, anyone?\n\nDave G.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, August 18, 2003, at 05:16 PM, brooksmoses1 wrote:\n\n&gt; So, supposing I want to create two gas mixtures in Matlab, with\n&gt; initially identical properties.  The naive way to do this is as\n&gt; follows:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g = air;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; h = g;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, this doesn&#39;t actually work, as the following shows:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; temperature(g)\n&gt;    300\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; set(h,&#39;T&#39;,600);\n&gt;&gt;&gt; temperature(h)\n&gt;    600\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; temperature(g)\n&gt;    600\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s happening, as I understand it, is that h and g are stored as\n&gt; pointers, and so &quot;h = g&quot; means creating a new pointer h that points\n&gt; to the same mixture as g.  And so there still is only one gas mixture\n&gt; extant.  Is this understanding correct?\n&gt;\n&gt; And the real question -- is there a built-in way of creating an h\n&gt; that is in fact a _separate_ copy of g?  Or do I have to do this\n&gt; manually, by defining a &quot;copy_mixture&quot; function from scratch that\n&gt; creates a &quot;blank&quot; h and then sets all the fractions and variables to\n&gt; equal those of g?  I looked through the Solution methods, and didn&#39;t\n&gt; see anything that appeared to be an obvious answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; If such a built-in function doesn&#39;t currently exist in Cantera, I&#39;d\n&gt; like to request it as a feature on future releases.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Brooks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
