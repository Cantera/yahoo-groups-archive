The MS VC v7.0 port is still pretty much a work in progress.\n\n1)  cvode -&gt; there was an absolute path name in the project file.\n           I replaced it with a relative path name.\n\n2) I forgot to include in my directions a rather troubling point about\n   compatibility issues between python modules and MS VC++. I&#39;ve added a\nstep\n   to the README file that describes how to compile cantera with\n   MS VC++ v7.0. (win32/README):\n\n   An error exit is generated by python v. 2.3&#39;s distutils module\n   whenever a user module is compiled with MS VC++ v7.0. Note, python was\n   compiled with  MS VC++ v6.0. I have found that just disabling the error\n   exit leads to acceptable behavior with no problems.\n\n   To disable the error exit, edit the file:\n          /cygdrive/c/python23/Lib/distutils/msvccompiler.py\n   Comment out lines 211 to 215 with &quot;#&quot; symbols.\n\n   Note, this module generates compiler command lines for python. During\n   Cantera&#39;s python build process, the distutils module actually takes over\n   the build process from Cantera&#39;s makefile, and carries out the\nbuild/install\n   operations. Therefore, there is no way around this step.\n\n   Note, python 2.4 is in alpha testing as of 9/2004. It&#39;s being built with\n   MSVC++ v7.0. I&#39;m not sure if this means similar problems await for\nCantera users\n   who want to use python 2.4 with MSVC++ v6.0.\n\n   (HKM -&gt; I&#39;ll try to find out more information about this whole issue in\n    the near future i.e., is there an upgraded distutils module?)\n\nSo, taking out an error exit from distutils module seems to work. The python\ntest problems all work. It&#39;s certainly less of a can-o-worms than\nrecompiling\npython. However, I do admit to being a little jittery with\nbinary-compatibility\nissues.\n\n3) Python is needed to convert the cti format into the ctml format (which is\n   xml based). The c++ kernel reads the ctml format using native c++.\n   However, most of the cxx_examples use cti input files. Therefore, python\n   is needed to run these examples. I think you&#39;re bringing up an\ninteresting\n   point about whether the c++ kernel should require python to function and\nwhether\n   the cti to ctml format conversion operation should be considered a kernel\n   operation. If so, then the cti to ctml converter should be written in\nc++,\n   which actually is no small amount of work; it&#39;s much easier to write\nparsers \n   in python.\n\n4) clib.dll is placed in Cantera&#39;s python site-package directory:\n      ~/python23/lib/site-package/Cantera\n   clib.dll is needed for Cantera&#39;s python interface.\n   I&#39;ve also changed the makefile script to place it in Cantera&#39;s install\nlib\n   directory.\n\n5) cxx_examples and the programs in test_programs aren&#39;t currently copied to\nthe\n   install directory tree from the build directory tree.\n\nBest wishes,\nHarry\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: brooksmoses1 [mailto:brooksmail@...]\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 2004 10:46 PM\nTo: cantera@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [cantera] MSVC 7.0 project files: installation problems.\n\n\n(Apologies if this shows up twice -- I tried to send it once before, \nbut it appears to have not gone through.)\n\nAt 07:45 PM 8/27/2004, David Goodwin wrote:\n&gt; Thanks to Harry Moffat, there is now a complete set of project files to \n&gt; compile Cantera using Visual C++ .NET on a PC.  No Fortran compiler is \n&gt; required.  They are currently available only via anonymous CVS.  To get \n&gt; them, you first need to check out the Cantera source distribution using \n&gt; anonymous CVS, and then go into the top-level Cantera directory and \n&gt; delete the entire &#39;win32&#39; directory.  Then from this top-level \n&gt; directory type at a command prompt &#39;cvs co win32&#39; to check out the new \n&gt; win32 module, which will replace the old win32 directory.  See the \n&gt; README file in this directory for complete instructions on how to build \n&gt; Cantera with Visual C++ .NET.\n\nI just tried to compile with this, following the directions in the \nrelevant README file, and had a few problems.\n\nFirst, when trying to build cantera.sln, I was unable to build \n&quot;cvode&quot; because it couldn&#39;t find the header files.  Copying the \nheader files into the directory with the cvode source files seems to \nwork as a workaround, but I presume there&#39;s some path munged up that \ncan be easily fixed.\n\nMore significantly, I can&#39;t get the makefiles to work right; they \nkeep exiting with errors.  Specifically, on the &quot;make win&quot; command:\n\n==============================================================\nBROOKS-GCEP:~/Projects/Cantera_Source/cantera&gt; make win\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera\nrm -r -f build/include/cantera/*\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/oneD\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/zeroD\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/converters\n/usr/bin/install -c -d build/include/cantera/kernel/transport\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/cxx/include/*.h build/include/cantera\n/usr/bin/install -c config.h build/include/cantera\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/*.h build/include/cantera/kernel\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/oneD/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/oneD\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/zeroD/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/zeroD\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/converters/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/converters\n/usr/bin/install -c Cantera/src/transport/*.h \nbuild/include/cantera/kernel/transport\ncd Cantera/python; make win\nmake[1]: Entering directory \n`/brooks/Projects/Cantera_Source/cantera/Cantera/python&#39;\ntouch src/pycantera.cpp\n(c:/python23/python.exe setup.py build)\nrunning build\nrunning build_py\nrunning build_ext\nerror: Python was built with version 6 of Visual Studio, and \nextensions need to be built with the same version of the compiler, \nbut it isn&#39;t installed.\nmake[1]: *** [_winbuild] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory \n`/brooks/Projects/Cantera_Source/cantera/Cantera/python&#39;\nmake: *** [python] Error 2\n==============================================================\n\n\nIf I take out the makefile command relating to the python stuff, then \nall the rest seems to run, but when I eventually get done with the \n&quot;make win-install&quot; command (which I also had to take a python-stuff \ncommand out of), and try to run the cxx-examples.exe file, I get all \nsorts of errors about &quot;ctml-write module not found&quot;.\n\nIs there a way to resolve this, or do I need to get the Python source \nand recompile it myself?  (And is doing this the family-sized can of \nworms that I fear it will be?)\n\nAnd, while I&#39;m asking: does this mean that those examples are \ndepending on Python to run, despite being part of the cxx example \nset?  Does this imply that all C++ cantera programs will need Python?\n\nAlso, some smaller questions related to the installation: the \n&quot;cantera&quot; solution builds a clib.dll file, but it doesn&#39;t actually \nseem to get put anywhere by the installation process.  What is \nsupposed to happen with that?  And the cxx-examples.exe and similar \nexample stuff; is that supposed to get put somewhere in the installed \ndirectory?\n\n\n(And, as a final note: it might be useful to somewhere note that the \nMatlab compiler is needed to compile the Matlab interface.  Although \nperhaps that&#39;s obvious to people who, unlike me, know the first thing \nabout making Matlab interfaces!)\n\nThanks,\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}}
