The process of converting .cti  \ninput files into XML files is now done by a single Python module that  \ndoes not use anything from Cantera.  If you are using Cantera from  \nMatlab or C++, you only need to install a single Python file  \n(&#39;ctml_writer.py&#39;) where Python can find it, and do not need to build  \nthe rest of the Python interface.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jun 1, 2004, at 4:28 PM, Michael Johnson wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Dave and cantera group,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to install cantera in my home directory on solaris 2.9\n&gt; Python is installed on the system, and I have added Numeric-23.1 in my\n&gt; home directory, with no problem.
