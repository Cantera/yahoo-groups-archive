New capabilities\n2. Better high-level documentation: user&#39;s manuals, for example, with  \nstep by step directions describing how to solve various types of  \nproblems.\n3. Code that is cleaner and easier to read and understand\n4. Maybe even a few new graphical apps, along the lines of MixMaster,  \nbut most-likely working through your web browser\n\nBut this will only be possible with help!  The actual coding work  \nwill be done mostly by members of the SourceForge.net Cantera  \nproject.  I will also refer to this group as the Cantera Developers  \nGroup, but it&#39;s just another name for the same group of people.\n\nAt present, the Developers Group has nine members, but we will lose  \nsome soon, since some of the members have recently changed jobs, and  \nno longer work with reacting flow simulation or similar problems.\n\nSo we&#39;re going to need some more people willing to volunteer their  \ntime to help us build a better Cantera, that we can then all use!\n\nWe&#39;re looking for people who can contribute in many different ways.   \nI&#39;d like to find a few good:\n\n1. C++ programmers\n2. Python programmers\n3. Application specialists: How can Cantera better serve YOUR field?\n4. Graphics Programmers\n5. and more.. Maybe you?\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in joining the development team. send a message  \ndescribing your experience, applications, sector (university,  \ngovernment, industry, etc ) to dggoodwin@....  Or  \nrecommend one of your colleagues and I&#39;ll talk to him/her!\n\nThanks\nDave\n\n\n\n\n"}}
