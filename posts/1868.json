I have\nstarted out by=\r\n first comparing the provided demos Flame1.m and\nflame1.py in an attempt to=\r\n understand the differences between the\nsimulations in Matlab and Python. I=\r\n have also been looking through the\ntutorial files provided with Cantera fo=\r\nr both Matlab and Python.\n\nI believe that the following statement in the py=\r\nthon file flame1.py\n\nf =3D BurnerFlame(gas =3D gas, grid =3D inital_grid)\n\n=\r\nis equivalent to the series of statements found throughout the Matlab\nfile =\r\nFlame1.m\n\n1)  f =3D AxisymmetricFlow(gas, &#39;flow&#39;);\n2)  set(f, &#39;P&#39;, p, &#39;grid=\r\n&#39;, inital_grid);\n3)  burner =3D Inlet(`burner&#39;);\n4)  s =3D Outlet(`out&#39;);\n5=\r\n)  f1 =3D flame(gas, burner, f, s);\n6)  setMaxJacAge(f1, max_jacobian_age(1=\r\n), max_jacobian_age(2));\n\nFrom there I went and compared the Pyhton files B=\r\nurnerFlame.py to\nFreeFlame.py in order to see what is unique about the Free=\r\nFlame\nsimulation and I concluded the following.\n\nFreeFlame.py introduces a =\r\nfew extra statements when compared to\nBurnerFlame.py See the list below.\n\n7=\r\n) from Cantera import _cantera\n8) self.tfix =3D tfix\n9) self.setFixedTemper=\r\nature(self.tfix)\n10) def setFixedTemperature(self, temp)\n11) _cantera.sim1D=\r\n_setFixedTemperature(self._hndl, temp)\n\nFreeFlame.py also modifies the foll=\r\nowing statements from BurnerFlame.py\n\n12) def _init_(self, gas =3D None, gr=\r\nid =3D None, tfix =3D 500.0): \nin this statement burner =3D None and outlet=\r\n =3D None is removed while\ntfix is added\n13) self.flame =3D AxisymmetricFlo=\r\nw(`flame&#39;, gas =3D gas, type=3D2)\nthe difference with this statement was th=\r\nat type=3D2 was added\n14) z1 =3D 0.5 is changed from 0.2\n15) locs =3D array=\r\n([0.0, 0.3, z1, 1.0], `d&#39;) the entry 0.3 is added to\nthe array\n16) self.set=\r\nProfile(`u&#39;, locs, [u0, u0, u1, u1]) a second u0 is added\n17) self.setProfi=\r\nle(`T&#39;, locs, [t0, t0, teq, teq]) a second u0 is added\n18) self.setProfile(=\r\ngas.speciesName(n), locs, [yin[n], yin[n], yeq[n],\nyeq[n]) a second yin[n] =\r\nis added.\n\nFrom this point I was looking to build the model of free_h2_air.=\r\npy in\nMatlab. I order to do this it looks as if I will need to\n\n- use the M=\r\natlab code in points 1 to 6 and modify it to add in the\neffects of the poin=\r\nts 7 to 18 which was used in the python code.\n\nA few questions\n\n- How do yo=\r\nu implement the tfix variable?\n- What does type=3D2 mean for AxisymmetricFl=\r\now?\n- Why is Z1 changed to .5?\n- Why is locs array modified to have 4 entri=\r\nes which in turn\nintroduces a second u0, t0 and yin[n] (points 15 to 18 abo=\r\nve)?\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions to help me understand how to do this=\r\n\nor can help explain this to me?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nChris Kelly\n\n\n--- =\r\nIn cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;transfertoschool&quot; &lt;ademator@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi=\r\n all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I was experimenting with the example free_h2_air.py and I have b=\r\neen\n&gt; able to run the example using python.
