I have been trying to run the cstr example\n&gt; posted in the files section.  However, when I try to run it as is, I\n&gt; get several errors of not recognizing functions.  I was able to fix\n&gt; those problems by adding different headers to the #include section.\n&gt; However, now I am getting over 200 errors involving the non\n&gt; recognition of many of the functions written in various classes.  As I\n&gt; have not read a post that deals with any problems with this code, is\n&gt; there a certain directory that I should be running the code out of, or\n&gt; certain compile methods that I am not using.  Currently I am simply\n&gt; compiling out of the include/cantera/ folder (where Cantera.h is) and\n&gt; using the command g++ cstr.cpp.  If anyone knows how to get this\n&gt; working, I would appreciate it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Anup Misra\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
