Radulescu&quot; &lt;matei@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; When one computes the the free-flame structure (say H2+air at P=\r\nTN),\n&gt; the equilibrium temperature obtained is different from the true\n&gt; ad=\r\niabatic flame temperature obtained via a direct equilibrium\n&gt; calculation, =\r\nusing the same thermo data.  The differences are on the\n&gt; order of 10K for =\r\nthe example given.  Likewise, the enthalpy in the\n&gt; flame of the equilibriu=\r\nm products is NOT found equal to reactants\n&gt; enthalpy, although theoretical=\r\nly, they should be equal.  This leads me\n&gt; to suspect that the non-conserva=\r\ntive flame calculations introduces\n&gt; order 1 errors in the species concentr=\r\nations of the products,\n&gt; consistent with the results of the simulations!  =\r\nAre these\n&gt; *acceptable* errors???\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
