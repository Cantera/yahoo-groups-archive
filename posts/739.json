You could of course specify each product pathway and rate individually \nwith integer stoichiometric coefficients.  The result is the same as long as the reactions are \nforward only.\n\n\nBrad Hitch\nSenior Engineer\nTDA Research, Inc.\n12345 W. 52nd Ave.\nWheat Ridge, CO 80033\n303-940-2318\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
