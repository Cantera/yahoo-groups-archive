I am looking forward=\r\n \nfor the new version 1.5.6, using the freely propagating flame model to \nd=\r\netermine laminar flame speeds similar than in PREMIX.\nThe reason why I am p=\r\nosting is that I am looking forward for n-\npentane, n-hexane and isooctane =\r\nmechanisms in cantera or Chemkin \nformat. I would like to compare determine=\r\nd laminar flame speeds for \nenvirement temperatures between 100=B0C-200=B0C=\r\n and pressures between 2 \nbar and 50 bar for above hydrocarbon/air mixtures=\r\n. I have done that \nfor n-heptane/air mixtures by using the spherical bomb =\r\nmethod.\nExperimental and numerical results match quite well with each other=\r\n. \nI would really look forward if someone has any mechanisms. If anyone \nha=\r\ns done similar experiments, please answer for discussion. \nThank you very m=\r\nuch in advance for an answer \n\nSven\n \n\n\n\n"}}
