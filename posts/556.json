The difference is the energy \nchange of the system.\n\nHow you get the products is up to you. For instance, if you have a \nconstant temperature, constant pressure process reaching equilibrium \nyou can use the &quot;equilibrate&quot; function with the &#39;TP&#39; flag set. If \nyou&#39;re using frozen chemistry you&#39;ll have to find mass or mole \nfractions through rate reactions that you manually stop.\n\nGood luck.\nChad\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, Surinder Prabhjot Singh \n&lt;prabhjot102@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; My question is related to constant temperature\n&gt; process. I  know we can carry out a reaction at\n&gt; constant temperature if we set energy=&quot;off&quot; in a\n&gt; reactor so that the energy equations are not\n&gt; integrated. But my question is how do I calculate the\n&gt; total energy change in a constant temperature process.\n&gt; I need to calculate the total energy evolved if I\n&gt; carry out a certain reaction at constant temperature?\n&gt; \n&gt; Surinder\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
