I have built\nthe .msi install=\r\ner using visual studio. However it does not seem like\nFortran gets installe=\r\nd in c:&#92;cantera&#92;. The source contains the Fortran\nfiles, but they do not ge=\r\nt transferred to the final folders. How do I\nset the build to include the F=\r\nortran files?\n\nI have tried to compile the Fortran files in the source and =\r\nthen\nmoving the resulting cantera.mod to the folder with the .f90 template\n=\r\nin the source (&#92;..&#92;tools&#92;templates&#92;f90&#92;demo.f90) and then running the\ndemo.=\r\nf90. However, there is a call to a missing routine\n&quot;ctfunc_importphase&quot; whi=\r\nch crashes the program. \n\nAny idea how to fix this thing?\nAnders\n\n\n"}}
