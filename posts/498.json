I am facing \na problem because the GRI MECH 3.0 database does not include ethanol. \nI am a new user of Cantera and hence need some guidance from you. It \nwould be of great help if you can give me some reference to related \ncodes. \nRegards,\nGagan\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Michael,\n&gt; \n&gt; Cantera flags some reactions as duplicatess that Chemkin does not.  \nAll \n&gt; you have to do is tell Cantera that you intend this by adding:\n&gt; \n&gt; options = &quot;duplicate&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; for each reaction it flags as an undeclared duplicate, for example:\n&gt; \n&gt; falloff_reaction( &quot;h + o2 (+ M) &lt;=&gt; ho2 (+ M)&quot;\n&gt;           kf = [4.52000E+013, 0, 0],\n&gt;           kf0   = [1.05000E+019, -1.257, 0],\n&gt;           efficiencies = &quot; ch4:10  co:1.9  co2:3.8  h2:0  h2o:0  \nn2:0 &quot;,\n&gt;           options = &quot;duplicate&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; This is done intentionallly, since a reaction like h + o2 (+ n2) \n&lt;=&gt; \n&gt; ho2 (+ n2) could also be written as h + o2 (+ M) &lt;=&gt; ho2 (+ M) with \nall \n&gt; efficiencies set to zero except the one for n2.\n&gt; Also, if you have two reactions\n&gt;   A + B &lt;=&gt; C + D\n&gt; and\n&gt; C + D &lt;=&gt; A + B\n&gt; Cantera says these are duplicates, but Chemkin does not.\n&gt; Cantera performs some other checks too, such as whether NASA \npolynomial \n&gt; thermo parameterizations are continuous at the midpoint \ntemperature, \n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; These extra checks can help find error in reaction mechanisms that \n&gt; might otherwise go unnoticed, which is especially a problem with \nvery \n&gt; large mechanisms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Aug 6, 2004, at 9:15 AM, Michael Johnson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Dave and group,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am trying to use the ethanol mechanism of Marinov, available at:\n&gt; &gt; www-cms.llnl.gov/combustion/combustion2.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ck2cti converts it to cti format with no problem, but there are \n&gt; &gt; three-body\n&gt; &gt; falloff reactions that have different low-pressure coefficients \nfor\n&gt; &gt; different third bodies and Cantera has problems with that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The reactions are:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #  Reaction 4\n&gt; &gt; falloff_reaction( &quot;h + o2 (+ M) &lt;=&gt; ho2 (+ M)&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;          kf = [4.52000E+013, 0, 0],\n&gt; &gt;          kf0   = [1.05000E+019, -1.257, 0],\n&gt; &gt;          efficiencies = &quot; ch4:10  co:1.9  co2:3.8  h2:0  h2o:0  \nn2:0 &quot;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #  Reaction 5\n&gt; &gt; falloff_reaction( &quot;h + o2 (+ n2) &lt;=&gt; ho2 (+ n2)&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;          kf = [4.52000E+013, 0, 0],\n&gt; &gt;          kf0   = [2.03000E+020, -1.59, 0])\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (and two others with n2 and h2o as third bodies)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The error I get with Cantera is:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Procedure: installReaction\n&gt; &gt; Error:   Undeclared duplicate reactions detected:\n&gt; &gt; Reaction 4: h + o2 (+ M) &lt;=&gt; ho2 (+ M)\n&gt; &gt; Reaction 5: h + o2 (+ n2) &lt;=&gt; ho2 (+ n2)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What can be done in this situation?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Michael\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
