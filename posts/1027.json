Your FlowReactor class is going to be very us=\r\neful.\nAny chance that future releases of FlowReactor might include surface\n=\r\nchemistry as well?\n\nI took a look at the ignite.m matlab function and think=\r\n I should be\nable to do something similar in Python using the functions fro=\r\nm the\nKinetics class (Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have access to Matlab). I have=\r\n\nan f2py&#39;d version of vode that I can use to do the integration. Thanks\naga=\r\nin.\n\nBest,\nPaul\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul,\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently using the Cantera Reactor class this is=\r\n hard to do.  It \n&gt; allows you to fix T, or solve the energy equation, but =\r\nit doesn&#39;t allow \n&gt; specified T(time), or P(time).\n&gt; \n&gt; For now, probably t=\r\nhe best thing to do is to write the ODEs yourself, \n&gt; and use Cantera to ev=\r\naluate the terms in the equations. See, for \n&gt; example, the Cantera MATLAB =\r\ndemos &quot;ignite.m&quot;, &quot;ignite2.m&quot;, and the \n&gt; function in the Cantera toolbox &quot;=\r\nreactor_ode.m&quot; for an example of this \n&gt; approach. The MATLAB stiff ODE int=\r\negrator used in these demos works \n&gt; fine for these problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a=\r\nctually written a new class &quot;FlowReactor&quot; that is closer to \n&gt; what you wan=\r\nt, but it is not ready for release yet.   It is designed to \n&gt; simulate rea=\r\ncting plug flow in a channel, and includes compressibility \n&gt; effects, heat=\r\n loss, friction, etc.  I&#39;ll make sure to allow specified \n&gt; T(x) and P(x) a=\r\ns an option.  I don&#39;t know precisely when this will be \n&gt; ready for release=\r\n - maybe in a couple of weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 8, 2005, at 8:04 AM=\r\n, peyelvington wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Group,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would like to simulate a=\r\n zero-d, variable-T,P reactor.
