Generally \nthis will be more helpful that requesting help from one person on the list.\n\nYou are getting an error when you try to run the demo.  I get an error \nwhen I compile it.  As far as I know the demos for cpp do not work in VS \nand have not been supported for a while.   I recommend either trying the \npython or MATLAB interfaces or write your own C++ code to test your install.\n\n\n\n\nShukla, Shashank wrote:\n&gt; Dear Rebecca,\n&gt;               thanks for replying. Yesterday I was able to finally compile \n&gt; cantera in visual studio 2003. I did&#39;nt made any changes in source code \n&gt; before compiling.\n&gt; The window installer file was generated when I clicked the build \n&gt; SetupCantera.(First timeI build SetupCanteraLite too, but second time build \n&gt; only SetupCantera, with disabling SetupCanteraLite build in configuration) . \n&gt;\n&gt; When I ran the cantera.msi, It ran just fine, asked where to install cantera\n&gt; (I specified different directory(c:&#92;CANTERA),than where I build Cantera), I \n&gt; ran python demos after that, which ran fine(I mean no error).\n&gt;\n&gt; After that I opened C++ demos from start menu icon. It opened visual studio, \n&gt; but showed a popup &quot;Project&#39;C:&#92;CANTERA&#92;demos&#92;C++&#92;Rankine&#92;Rankine.vcproj&#39; \n&gt; failed to open &quot; \n&gt; Popup has a tab saying ok. On clicking it and opening &quot;demo.cpp&quot; \n&gt; On building solution It shows the following error-&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------ Build started: Project: demo, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------\n&gt;\n&gt; Compiling...\n&gt; demo.cpp\n&gt; c:&#92;CANTERA&#92;include&#92;cantera&#92;equilibrium.h(8) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open \n&gt; include file: &#39;kernel/equil.h&#39;: No such file or directory\n&gt;\n&gt; Build log was saved at &quot;file://c:&#92;Cantera&#92;demos&#92;C++&#92;Debug&#92;BuildLog.htm&quot;\n&gt; demo - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------- Done ----------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;     Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 skipped\n&gt;\n&gt; demc:&#92;CANTERA&#92;include&#92;cantera&#92;equilibrium.h(8): fatal error C1083: Cannot \n&gt; open include file: &#39;kernel/equil.h&#39;: No such file or directory\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think build process has malfunctioned, and is not putting up files at the \n&gt; places it should or rather not putting them altogether. I&#39;m attaching \n&gt; my .msi, pls see if it is of same size what you got. I&#39;m getting the source \n&gt; code using wincvs, I believe its the latest version. I believe release 1.6 \n&gt; can&#39;t be compiled on windows (its .tar), I tried the method you told me,( \n&gt; first build in debug, and then build in release) but the error same as above.\n&gt; Any help will be greatly appreciable.

If so, are you \n&gt;&gt; using MATLAB, C++, or Python?  What errors do you get?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you mean you get errors while compiling, here are some questions:\n&gt;&gt; Are you getting the code from the CVS repository?  I have recently \n&gt;&gt; compiled both Release_1_6_0_Rev1 and the latest code without problem.  \n&gt;&gt; Did you make any changes at all in the code before trying to compile? \n&gt;&gt; Did you change the configuration to release?  (I usually compile with \n&gt;&gt; Debug once to make sure everything gets built and then release).\n&gt;&gt; Did you build and install the SetupCanteraLite or SetupCantera? \n&gt;&gt; What are the errors you are getting?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt; Rebecca\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; shashank shukla wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Rebecca,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;               I&#39;m a graduate student in texas a&m uni., I&#39;m facing a \n&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of problems in compiling cantera from source code. I&#39;ll be highly \n&gt;&gt;&gt; debtful if you can tell me the steps for compiling cantera (1.5.5 or \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.6) on visual studio. I&#39;m using microsoft visual studio 7. I tried \n&gt;&gt;&gt; following instruction given in the pdf of building cantera in c++, \n&gt;&gt;&gt; but  visual studio is giving a lot of run time errors when I try to \n&gt;&gt;&gt; follows those. expecting a reply. regards.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; shashank shukla\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, R A Hunt &lt;rahunt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Tt was fabulous that version 1.5 included a Visual Studio .net \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution file.  It made cantera fantastically easy to build from \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; source.  It also included a compenent for building an installer.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, it doesn&#39;t look like version 1.6 has a solution file or a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         \n&gt;&gt;&gt; even \n&gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; win32 directory.
