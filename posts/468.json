(If you have one it fails on, please send it to me along \nwith details of how you were converting it.)\n\nIf you installed Cantera from the workshop CD,  you should upgrade as \nsoon as possible, since that version (but not prior net versions) had a \nbug that kept Chemkin file translation from working at all.\n\nThe source distributions have not been updated yet, but of course the \nsource code is always available by CVS.\nPlease let me know if there are any problems with this installer.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
