We need\n&gt; to be able to access the sixth thermodynamic coefficient of=\r\n the lower\n&gt; temperature fit for a given component.  This value is altered =\r\nin our\n&gt; code to change the reference enthalpy value for a given ingredient=\r\n. \n&gt; In our case (in which we are modeling solid rocket propellants) the\n&gt; =\r\nenthalpy reference value sometimes needs to be altered to take into\n&gt; accou=\r\nnt an enthalpy change associated with the addition of a\n&gt; particular type o=\r\nf curative in a given amount.  We have found it is\n&gt; easier to change this =\r\nvalue on the fly rather than to change the input\n&gt; values in the mechanism =\r\nfile.  I was curious if there is currently any\n&gt; way to access these values=\r\n from within Cantera.  If not, is there some\n&gt; way to get this built in?  W=\r\ne need to be able to change the value of\n&gt; this coefficient, and not just g=\r\net its value.  Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dan Smyth\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
