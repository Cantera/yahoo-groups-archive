Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\nOur code HCT and =\r\na PSR code based on Chemkin both do this problem \nvery well.  The key is to=\r\n specify an inlet boundary flux with each \nspecies concentration set to a d=\r\nesired value, and an exit fixed \npressure boundary.  Conceptually, this is =\r\neasily done by using a \npremixed laminar flame set of boundary conditions, =\r\nbut collapsing the \nreaction zone of the flame into a single, therefore wel=\r\nl mixed, \nreaction zone.  The inflow is given by specifying the fluxes of e=\r\nach \nspecies, and the exit is determinined by specifying the outlet \npressu=\r\nre.  In a sense, it&#39;s a homogeneous problem, but we compute it \nin a pseudo=\r\n-1D formulation.\n\nAs your note suggests, the trick is the residence time.  =\r\nThe Chemkin \nPSR code does this elegantly, the HCT version does it by setti=\r\nng the \npseudo-1D zone thickness so that the combination of the inlet flow =\r\n\nvelocity and the zone thickness produce an effective residence time. \nI ca=\r\nn provide references if desired.\n\nCharlie Westbrook\nLLNL\n\n"}}
