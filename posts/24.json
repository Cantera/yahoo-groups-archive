There was a \nsmall bug that caused it to use the wrong name for the thermo \ndatabase.\n\nIt also has been modified to read parameters from file &#39;zero.inp&#39; if \nit exists in the local directory. This allows you to simply click on \nthe icon for zero.exe in Windows to run it.\n\n--------------------\n\nIt also contains the Fortran source, and you should be able to modify \nit and rebuild it if you have Compaq Visual Fortran 6.0. It should \ncompile with standard default settings if you add all *.f files to \nyour project. To link it, just link to ctf.lib and use the \nmultithreaded DLL Fortran libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
