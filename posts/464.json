It would interesting to know which part of the HCT\nmethodology accounts for the robustness:\n\n1) finite volume vs. finite difference\n2) fully compressible vs. isobaric\n3) eulerian/lagrangian vs. eulearian\n4) unsteady vs. steady (w/ time-stepping)\n\nI would think most of the robustness of HCT comes from using the fully\ncompressible formulation (2)\nwhich provides time dependent terms for density and the axial velocity.\n This would improve the diagonal \ndominance of the system Jacobian and improve the convergence of the\nNewton iterations.  There would\nalso seemed be some benefit of a looser coupling of density and\ntemperature in the ideal gas equation by\nallowing the pressure to vary.\n\nDave H.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; westbrook1@... 8/2/2004 11:34:37 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;\nTo anyone interested,\n\nWe have had a lot of involvement with very large reaction mechanisms, \nand we have found that Chemkin does not perform well for our large \nmechanisms.  In cases where Chemkin cannot converge on an initial \nflame model, we can run the same flame on our own code, HCT, and then \nuse that solution to get within the &quot;radius of convergence&quot; of the \nsolution for Chemkin.  Our HCT code &quot;never fails to converge&quot;, which \nis largely due to its fairly primitive first-order, backward \ndifference solution technique.  I suggest for people running either \nCantera or Chemkin, if you can force either to run using this \nsolution technique, you can probably get an answer, then refine the \ndifferencing in subsequent runs that start from the first set of \nsolutions.  The first-order, backward differencing is supposed to be \nunconditionally stable if done properly, and our experience is that \nit works, even if you don&#39;t much like the solution.   I don&#39;t know if \nyou can force this in Cantera, but it might be a valuable feature.\n\nCharlie Westbrook\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt;I have 50 or so converged laminar flame cases in Chemkin II Premix,\nmost for\n&gt;the experiments from the literature. Fuels are from methane to\nbenzene,\n&gt;low-p to atmospheric, simulated with a few detailed kinetic models\nfrom the\n&gt;literature and with two of my own, ranging from 100 to 1200 reactions.\n(200\n&gt;or so runs in total). All the flames have temperature profile from\nthe\n&gt;experiment. That&#39;s kind of a lot for the e-mail attachment.\n&gt;\n&gt;For about a third of those runs I have cantera solution as well, all\nwith\n&gt;multicomponent diffusion. Differences between cantera and CK Premix\n&gt;solutions are  in most cases negligible. In few cases I examined in\ndetail,\n&gt;the differences originate from your improvenments in diffusion\nformulation.\n&gt;\n&gt;To my experience, Cantera (my Python premixed script) handles many a\ncase on\n&gt;which CK Premix gives up, but I have a handfull of cases that neither\ncode\n&gt;could find a solution for.\n&gt;\n&gt;Which address would you like the stuff sent to? I e-mailed you one of\nmy\n&gt;premixed Python/Cantera scripts to &#39;dgoodwin@...&#39; on May 11,\nbut I\n&gt;never heard back from you...\n&gt;\n&gt;Sincerely,\n&gt;             Zoran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am interested in doing some validation tests of the flame models in\n&gt;Cantera, and would like to ask the assistance of anyone who routinely\n&gt;runs flame simulations with the Chemkin version 2 codes PREMIX and/or\n&gt;OPPDIFF.  What I am looking for are any converged, resolved flame\n&gt;solutions from Chemkin 2, including:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) PREMIX or OPPDIFF input files\n&gt;2) reaction mechanism and thermo data files in Chemkin format\n&gt;3) computed species and temperature profiles in some text file format\n&gt;\n&gt;I am particularly interested in non-trivial flames with large\n&gt;mechanisms or at atmospheric pressure or above (but any flame is\n&gt;useful).  I would also like to have examples both with\nmixture-averaged\n&gt;and multicomponent diffusion.  If you have this information for some\n&gt;flame or flames, please send me a tar or zip file with the files\nlisted\n&gt;above.  I will take this information, generate the corresponding\n&gt;Cantera input files + python script, and compare the computed\nprofiles\n&gt;(unless you want to do that too...).  I would plan on then sending\nback\n&gt;to you the Cantera files, so that you could run a Cantera vs. Chemkin\n2\n&gt;timing comparison on the same machine.\n&gt;\n&gt;Based on previous comparisons of thermo properties, transport\n&gt;properties, and kinetic rates, I fully expect excellent agreement in\n&gt;the steady-state flame profiles, with substantial improvement in\n&gt;performance.  But a head-to-head flame comparison would be very\n&gt;interesting, and would provide assurance to users converting from the\n&gt;Chemkin 2 codes that Cantera produces the same output, given the same\n&gt;input.\n&gt;\n&gt;This will be most useful if we can get at least several flames from\n&gt;different groups, running on different machines, etc.\n&gt;If you have been wanting to contribute to the development of Cantera\n&gt;and its acceptance by the combustion community, but aren&#39;t an expert\nin\n&gt;C++/Python, etc., here&#39;s a good opportunity to do so!\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
