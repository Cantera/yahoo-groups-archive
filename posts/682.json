I have read that there should \ncome out a new version of cantera in January by which you can \ncalculate the 1-D adiabatic laminar flame speed with Matlab and \nPython, similar to what the PREMIX-package can do in CHEMKIN. Does \nanybody knows when this version will be posted?\nAnother question I have is about the spherical transient 1-d flame \nspeed calculation under constant volume conditions.\nIs there maybe someone who has planed or already has written a code \nfor that kind of problem? Or is it maybe planed in the future to \nimplement this in Cantera?\nThank you very much in advance for an answer.\n\nBest regards\nSven \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
