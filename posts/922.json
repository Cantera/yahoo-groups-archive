DeCaluwe wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Dr. Goodwin,\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello, this is Steven DeCaluwe, at the University of Maryland.  I am\n&gt; trying to model charge-transfer reactions at the TPB in an\n&gt; anode-supported SOFC.  However, after reading the pdf on creating cti\n&gt; files, I am having trouble entering code for these reactions that\n&gt; cantera/python is able to translate.  For example, here is one\n&gt; reaction I have attempted to enter:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; #  Reaction 0004\n&gt; charge_transfer_reaction( &quot;H_c(S) + OH_e(S) = NI(S) + H2O_e(S) +\n&gt; e_Ni&quot;,\n&gt; \t\t[5e15, 0, (90, &#39;kJ/mol&#39;)]\n&gt; \t)\n&gt;\n&gt; Are there other parameters that need to be entered?  As I remember,\n&gt; the Beta value is optional, with a default of 0.5.  I also remember\n&gt; you mentioning that the potentials of the different phases can be\n&gt; specified; does this need to be done in the cti file, or can it be\n&gt; done through the matlab interface?  (I hope it is the latter).\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, if I simply change the reaction type to &quot;surface_reaction,&quot;\n&gt; my xml is created just fine, but obviously, these rates wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; accurately represent the kinetics I am attempting to simulate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt; Steven DeCaluwe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
