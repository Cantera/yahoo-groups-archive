I use Cantera in\nMatlab (version 7, Release 14).  It appears that the &#39;display.m&#39; file\nwas omitted from the ...&#92;cantera&#92;@Solution directory.  Currently, when\na Gas Object is called in Matlab, I only see the:\n\nG = \n\n\tSolution object: 1-by-1\n\nmessage.  I added the old (v1.5.4, I think) &#39;display.m&#39; file to the\nappropriate folder, and the old &quot;solution display&quot; functionality is\nrestored.\n\nI see that in your new Tutorial file, the display functionality is\nupdated with enthalpy, entropy, etc. values.  It would be great to\nhave this in the new v1.6.0, but in the meantime, I figured I&#39;d let\nyou know that this file is missing so that you can add either the old\none, or hopefully the new one to the .msi installer.  Also, it appears\nthat the &#39;clear.m&#39; file is missing from that folder as well, although\nI don&#39;t know how critical it is to use Cantera&#39;s clear as opposed to\nMatlab&#39;s internal clear function.\n\nI&#39;m going to continue to play around with 1.6.0, and I&#39;ll let you know\nif I come across anything else.\n\nThanks,\n-A.J.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
