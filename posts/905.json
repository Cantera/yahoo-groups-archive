DeCaluwe wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering--is there any way for the matlab interface to produce\n&gt; an array of charges for each species within a phase?  There aren&#39;t\n&gt; any apparent candidates in the toolbox, but I thought I&#39;d check.\n&gt;\n&gt; Much thanks,\n&gt; Steven DeCaluwe\n&gt;\n&gt; ps.  regarding my troubles with the &#39;display&#39; function last week, the\n&gt; issue still hasn&#39;t been solved.  I followed your instructions, Dr.\n&gt; Goodwin, it worked in python, and I&#39;m certain that it is accessing\n&gt; the correct &#39;display&#39; function in the matlab toolbox, but it still\n&gt; produces no output.  I&#39;m wondering if it could be some deleterious\n&gt; effect of using matlab 6.1, versus a more current edition?  The\n&gt; function isn&#39;t incredibly vital to my current modeling efforts, so\n&gt; I&#39;m not going to pursue it much further, but I thought I&#39;d give an \n&gt; update.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
