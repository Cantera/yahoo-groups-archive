However, as always, new bugs have popped up.  This one seems \nto concern my input files.  I have created a custom input file, and \nsuccessfully converted it to .cti format and .xml format.  There \nappear to be no errors at all in these files.  However when I try to \ncreate an IdealGasMix in C++, I get this error: \n************************************************\n                Cantera Error!                  \n************************************************\n\n\nProcedure: IdealGasMix\nError:     buildSolutionFromXML returned false\n\n\nThis only happens when using my own .cti files, and does not occur \nwhen using the ones provided with the source.  If anyone has had this \nproblem before and knows how to fix it, I would appreciate all the \nhelp I can get. \n\nThanks, \n\nAnup Misra\n\n\n"}}
