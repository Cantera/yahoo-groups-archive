The file in question is the  \nbinary installer for the Cantera Python package, which should have been  \nbuilt when you built the python project before building &#39;SetupCantera.&#39;  \n  Perhaps the problem is that building the python project is failing. If  \nnecessary, you can go to the Cantera python directory and execute the  \ncommand &#39;python setup.py bdist_wininst&#39; to manually create this file.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jun 14, 2005, at 11:27 AM, Karl Meredith wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I am porting Cantera from Visual C++ 6.0 to .NET\n&gt; I have followed the instructions in the cantera155-build-win32.pdf\n&gt; file on sourceforge.
