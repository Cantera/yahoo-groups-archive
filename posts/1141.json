The meeting will be here at Caltech (Pasadena, CA).\n\nThe motivation for this meeting is that several different organizations \nhave  plans to use Cantera in large software projects, but require \ncertain changes to the code before they can use it (support for other \nplatforms, more templating in the C++ code, etc.).  Cantera has grown \nto the point that I no longer know of all uses, so making a change to \nsatisfy one user or organization may well cause problems for others. I \nthink it may be time to develop a more open procedure for proposing and \nimplementing code changes.\n\nI would like to invite everyone with a serious interest in the future \nof Cantera to participate.  I would especially welcome participation \nfrom:\n\n1. The &quot;Cantera gurus&quot; who know the C++ code in detail (you know who \nyou are)\n2.  Anyone representing organizations that are or plan to be serious \nCantera users\n3. Anyone with a strong opinion on aspects of Cantera (XML, CTI, ...)\n4. Anyone  who has experience managing other large, open source \nsoftware projects\n\n\nSome of the topics I want to address include:\n\n1. What process should be used to decide on major code changes?  Would\nsomething like the PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) process used by\nPython developers work for Cantera?\n\n2. Should a &quot;Cantera Software Foundation&quot; be established? Python has a\nfoundation, Apache does too, and many other large open-source software\nprojects. This would allow transferring the copyright to the\nfoundation, so that hopefully people at multiple institutions could\ncontribute code without their lawyers getting involved.  This would\nalso provide a way for tax-deductible donations to be made to support a\nsmall grants program to fund proposals to enhance Cantera, or to\ndevelop short courses, etc.\n\n3. Can we figure out a way to get more people involved in Cantera\ndevelopment, and to take responsibility for specific parts of Cantera?\nFor example, I would like to find someone willing to commit to being\nthe &quot;Windows guru&quot;, responsible for insuring that the latest versions\nof Cantera developed on unix/Mac platforms build on Windows in Visual\nStudio, and generally be the &quot;go to&quot; person for Windows-related issues.\n  Similarly, I wouldn&#39;t mind off-loading responsibility for the MATLAB\ninterface either.\n\n4. What changes do you feel are needed in Cantera?  What projects are\nor will be using Cantera in your organization?\n\n\nIf you are interested in participating, send me an email \n(dgoodwin@...) for more information.\n\nDave\n\n\n"}}
