I get an error\n&gt; however when I try to open the &#39;Reaction Paths...&#39; window, see text\n&gt; from the cmd prompt below. When the Reaction Paths window opens it is\n&gt; blank, it seems that &#39;rxnpath.gif&#39; is not recognized.\n&gt;   Have others had this problem? I saw no similar posts, except 662\n&gt; which had a different MixMaster problem. I do not look forward to\n&gt; reinstalling everything as all the other functions seem to work (I am\n&gt; using the Matlab interface).
