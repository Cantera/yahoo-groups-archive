This may be a standard\n           Chemkin-format thermo database, or may be any\n           Chemkin-format input file containing a THERMO section.\n\ntrandb - Transport database. File containing species transport\n         parameters in Chemkin format. If this argument is \nomitted,\n         the CTI file will not contain transport property \ninformation.\n\nidtag - ID tag. Used to identify the ideal_gas entry in the CTI \nfile. Optional.\n\ndebug - If set to 1, extra debugging output will be written. This\n        should only be used if ck2cti fails, in order to view\n        intermediate output of the parser. Default: off (0).\n\nvalidate - If set to 1, the mechanism will be checked for errors. \nThis\n           is recommended, but for very large mechanisms may slow \ndown\n           the conversion process. Default: on (1).\n\nIf you still have troubles converting your mechanism. Feel free to \ncontact me, I can convert them for you.\n\nBhupinder\n\n\nOn Fri Dec 02 18:10:06 EST 2005, storeybd &lt;brian.storey@...&gt; \nwrote:\n\n&gt; Hello:\n&gt; \n&gt; I am having trouble getting the ck2cti utility to work. I seem to \n&gt; be\n&gt; running into two problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) When I run with all three input files, the program seems to \n&gt; run\n&gt; fine, the log file says that the program has been successful and \n&gt; I can\n&gt; see that it has processed the reactions and the thermodynamic \n&gt; data,\n&gt; but I get no output. The program just sits there and does not \n&gt; return\n&gt; the output data or the command prompt. 2) The mechanism that I am \n&gt; most interested in using does not have transport data (I don&#39;t \n&gt; need it). The program seems to crash when the\n&gt; transport file is not included. If I check the log file it \n&gt; appears\n&gt; that everything up through the thermo data and the mechanism is\n&gt; successful. Is there a way to force the program to not need the\n&gt; transport data?  Any thoughts on why this is crashing?\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, I cannot find in the help what is meant by the option \n&gt; -id\n&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;. I am not using this option so perhaps that is my \n&gt; problem. As a test, I have been trying to convert the mechanisms \n&gt; given by\n&gt; livermore as a test and have been unsuccessful with them all. \n&gt; http://www-cms.llnl.gov/combustion/combustion2.html\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has any advice, I would be most grateful.
