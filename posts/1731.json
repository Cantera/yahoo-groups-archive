For instance,=\r\n although the\n&#39;InterfaceKinetics&#39; kinetics manager implements the virtual f=\r\nunction :\n  void InterfaceKinetics::getActivationEnergies(doublereal *E)\nth=\r\ne GasKinetics class does not.\n\nI tried implementing the &#39;getActivationEnerg=\r\nies&#39; function in the\nGasKinetics class and had no success.  The reaction pr=\r\noperties could\ntheoretically be accessed from the member GasKinetics::m_rat=\r\nes of type\nRate1&lt;Arrhenius&gt;, where :\n\n  template&lt;class R&gt;\n  class Rate1 {\n =\r\n   ...\n  public:\n    const R& rateCoeff(int loc) const { return m_rates[loc=\r\n]; } \n    ...\n    protected:\n       std::vector&lt;R&gt;            m_rates;\n    =\r\n   std::vector&lt;int&gt;           m_rxn;\n  }\n\nHowever, the members of Rate1 are=\r\n protected.   The public member\nRate1::rateCoef() could be used, but the ob=\r\nject Rate1::m_rxn would\nstill be required to ascertain which reaction the r=\r\nate calculator is\nassociated with.\n\nIs there a public member function defin=\r\ned somewhere else that I could use?\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nMarc\nPhD Candida=\r\nte, \nUniversity of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies\n\n\n"}}
