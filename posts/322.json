But here&#39;s another possibility: Cantera maintains an  \ninternal list of all C++-level objects created, and references them by  \nintegers. You could in principle just pass these integers around, and  \nleave the state information stored in the C++ objects.  To see how to  \naccess information from these objects, take a look at the files in  \nCantera/matlab/cantera/private (for example reactormethods.cpp) and  \nCantera/clib/src (especially ct.cpp and ctreactor.cpp) in the source  \ndistribution.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Mar 19, 2004, at 2:25 PM, freehdom wrote:\n\n&gt; It&#39;s been a few months since the original message was posted, but has\n&gt; anyone made any progress with passing chemistry between two objects\n&gt; (e.g. two reactors in series) within Simulink?\n&gt;\n&gt; One solution I&#39;m still working on is to pass two state variables\n&gt; (e.g. T,P) and the mole fraction array (from &#39;moleFractions(gas)&#39;)\n&gt; between objects. At the beginning of the second reactor, the &#39;set&#39;\n&gt; command can be used to match the inlet of reactor 2 with the outlet\n&gt; of reactor 1. All of the variables passed are numerical values and\n&gt; may solve Brooks&#39; problem described below. However, this assumes that\n&gt; the same mechanism is used in both reactors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a more efficient and robust method of tracking the chemistry\n&gt; and thermodynamics throughout a Simulink system?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks -\n&gt;\n&gt; Josh\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Our research group has recently been trying to integrate Cantera\n&gt;&gt; calculations into some Matlab Simulink models, and it looks like\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s a somewhat difficult process to get the two of them to work\n&gt;&gt; together in such a way as to be able to pass around mixture objects\n&gt;&gt; via Simulink links.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As I understand it, the primary problem appears to be that Simulink\n&gt;&gt; wants to only handle numbers and arrays of numbers; it doesn&#39;t (as\n&gt;&gt; far as we can find) have a capacity to pass objects.  I expect the\n&gt;&gt; solution would be some form of creating a Cantera mixture object\n&gt;&gt; (i.e. &quot;heavyweight&quot; reaction-mechanism object, as per earlier\n&gt;&gt; discussion of copying objects to track multiple states), extracting\n&gt;&gt; the pointer to this object in a form that Simulink can treat as a\n&gt;&gt; number, combining it with the numerical state information to make a\n&gt;&gt; &quot;plain&quot; vector representation that Simulink can pass around, and\n&gt;&gt; then reconstructing the relevant mixture objects from this within\n&gt;&gt; each Simulink block.  This seems like a rather complicated wheel to\n&gt;&gt; reinvent if someone&#39;s already done it, though, particularly if\n&gt;&gt; there are complications to it that I haven&#39;t forseen!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So: Has anyone on the list done this (or something similar)\n&gt;&gt; already, and if so can you offer some advice and perhaps examples\n&gt;&gt; of how to make this work?  Does the potential solution that I have\n&gt;&gt; seem like it&#39;s on the right track, and are there any nonobvious\n&gt;&gt; pitfalls I should look out for?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks much,\n&gt;&gt; - Brooks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
