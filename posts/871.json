If you are using Cantera \n&gt; on linux/unix/Mac OSX, I recommend that you upgrade to this release.  \n&gt; On a Mac, I have verified that everything runs: &#39;make test&#39; succeeds, \n&gt; and all Python and MATLAB demos run. Under linux, &#39;make test&#39; succeeds \n&gt; and the Python demos work, but I currently do not have access to a \n&gt; linux machine with MATLAB installed, so I can&#39;t build and test the \n&gt; MATLAB toolbox.\n\nHello Dave,\n  \nMy Linux SuSE8.3 installation problem was solved when I defined\nHAS_NUMERIC to 1  in the config.h file. Somehow it was left undefined.\nNow install and make test worked with python modules as well.\nI could not get configure to set that var correctly even after I\ninstalled python2.4 and numeric. Earlier try was python2.3.4.\n\nRegards,\n-osman\n\n\n\n\n"}}
