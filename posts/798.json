This means that Cantera will look for \nthese species / reactions in file gri30.xml, instead of in the local \nfile.  The gri30.xml file comes with Cantera.\n\n&gt; (2) what is the role of the file h2o2.xml? Is\n&gt; it an output file, or is it being used during the\n&gt; flame calculations?\n\nWhen Cantera reads a .cti input file, it first converts it to another \nformat and gives it the extension .xml.  The xml file is then read to \nbuild the objects used in the application program.  You can regard the \n.xml file as an internal intermediate file that you don&#39;t have to worry \nabout.  Alternatively, once you have created the xml file, you can use \nit in place of the cti file in your program.  This is useful if you \nwant to run Cantera on a machine that does not have Python installed, \nsince Python is required to do the cti -&gt; xml conversion but not to \nread the xml file.\n\n&gt; (3) I modified the file h2o2.cti, such that it contains\n&gt; ideal_gas(name = &quot;ohmech&quot;,\n&gt;       elements = &quot; O  H  Ar  N &quot;,\n&gt;       species = &quot;&quot;&quot; H2  H  O  O2  OH  H2O  HO2  H2O2  AR  N2 &quot;&quot;&quot;,\n&gt;       reactions = &quot;all&quot;,\n&gt;       transport = &quot;Mix&quot;,\n&gt;       initial_state = state(temperature = 300.0,\n&gt;       pressure = OneAtm)    ).\n&gt; However, when I perform the flame calculation I get\n&gt; the error message species &quot;N2&quot; unknown. Why do I get\n&gt; this error mesage?\n&gt;\nBecause it is looking for a definition of species &quot;N2&quot; in the local \nfile, but not finding one.\n\n&gt; PS. To replace AR by N2 I redefined AR in the .cti file,\n&gt; such that it contains 2 nitrogen atoms and accompanying\n&gt; physical data. This seems to work.\nThat works. Or you can just add a species entry for N2 in addition to \nAR.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
