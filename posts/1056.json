Now=\r\n we need to decide whether to do it or not.  \n&gt; I&#39;d like to get some sense =\r\nof how useful people feel a Cantera workshop \n&gt; would be, and how many migh=\r\nt attend if it were held in Heidelberg on \n&gt; Sunday, August 6.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we d=\r\no it, I would like much of the workshop to consist of \n&gt; contributed talks =\r\nfrom Cantera users on what you are doing with Cantera \n&gt; in research or tea=\r\nching.  But of course I could talk about future \n&gt; directions for Cantera (=\r\nor whatever else people are interested in) too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another option would b=\r\ne to hold a workshop somewhere else.  This might \n&gt; be preferred by non-com=\r\nbustion Cantera users, who wouldn&#39;t be in \n&gt; Heidelberg. (There&#39;s always th=\r\ne &quot;Westin La Cantera&quot; golf resort near \n&gt; San Antonio, Texas...)\n&gt; \n&gt; Let m=\r\ne know what you think, either by posting to the user&#39;s group, or \n&gt; by send=\r\ning me an email message.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
