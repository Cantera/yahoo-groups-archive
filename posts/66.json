So far I \nam \n&gt; impressed with the program and would like to congratulate you on \n&gt; producing this software. I notice in the Fortran manual that it \nshould \n&gt; be possible to perform reaction path analyses with the current \nversion \n&gt; of Cantera however I have not managed to locate the appropriate \nmodule \n&gt; for this. Any clues as to where I should look would be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that currently sensistivity analysis cannot be \nperformed \n&gt; with Cantera, do you plan to add sensitivity analysis in the near \n&gt; future or are you focussing your development efforts in other areas?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob Tranter\n&gt; Dept.
