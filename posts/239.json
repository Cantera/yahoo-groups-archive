With that done, it will be possible to configure Cantera\n&gt; for its ultimate destination (/usr, in this case), but actually\n&gt; install it someplace else (here, a sandboxed environment until it is\n&gt; merged with the live filesystem).  I have already\n&gt; made the necessary changes to my copy of the makefile.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since the changes are fully backward-compatible, and since they will\n&gt; make packaging easier [or even possible] for source-based\n&gt; distributions, would it be possible to merge the changes into the\n&gt; current version of Cantera?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks very much!\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jon Chambers\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
