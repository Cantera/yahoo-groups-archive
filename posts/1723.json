To the authors of these messages - I&#39;m sorry it took  \nme so long to approve them; I&#39;ve been preoccupied with some medical  \nissues in my family for a few weeks, and frankly my attention to  \nCantera waned during this time.  I am happy to report that the  \nmedical issues have now been largely resolved (successfully) and  \nthere should no longer be such a long lag time in approving new  \nmessages.\n\nSome background:   The user&#39;s group is configured so that I have to  \napprove messages from new members.  This was done a few years ago, to  \nstop people who were joining the group only to post ads about their  \nproduct or service (prescription medication from Canada, dating  \nservices, etc.) and who had NO INTEREST in Cantera.  Once new members  \nhave made a post or two that shows that the messages have appropriate  \ncontent for the User&#39;s Group, then their status is changed, so that  \nthey can submit messages directly, without requiring my approval of  \neach message.\n\nOf course, this all breaks down if the &quot;approver&quot; is for any reason  \nunavailable...  I will look into the possibility of adding a few  \nothers to the set of &quot;message approvers&quot;, to avoid situations like  \nthis in the future.\n\n  \n\n"}}
