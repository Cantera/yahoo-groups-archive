After I installed \n1.5.4, I am having trouble converting a particular mechanism file \ninto the .cti file. I was able to convert it with the older version \nthough.\n\nThe mechanism is a surrogate for JP8. I checked out the ck2cti.log \nfor the error and I see that many species are read together as one \nspecie. For example H2O and CO2 are read as H2OCO2. I have tried \nchanging the order of the species and I get the same error.How do I \nrectify this?\n\nThanks,\n\nNiveditha\n\n\n"}}
