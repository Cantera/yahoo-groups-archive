It seems for me that two extra nodes can be safely=\r\n \nomitted because all transport information is included in &quot;speciesData&quot; \nn=\r\node. Is it correct? Also, &quot;phase&quot; node in the example has the \nattribute &quot;d=\r\nim&quot; while ck2ctml converter does not produce this \nattribute. Is this attri=\r\nbute unimportant or can be also safely \nomitted?  \n\n\nThank you,\n\nAnatoli Mo=\r\nkhov\n\n  \n\n\n\n"}}
