In my stagnation-point flame simulations, I added the\n&gt; following commands to StagnationFlow.py:\n&gt; \n&gt;     def density(self, point):\n&gt;     \tself.setGasState(point)\n&gt;     \treturn self.gas.density()\n&gt;     \t\n&gt;     def viscosity(self, point):\n&gt;       self.setGasState(point)\n&gt;     \treturn self.gas.viscosity()\n&gt;     \t\n&gt;     def thermalConductivity(self, point):\n&gt;       self.setGasState(point)\n&gt;     \treturn self.gas.thermalConductivity()\n&gt; \n&gt;     def meanMolarMass(self, point):\n&gt;       self.setGasState(point)\n&gt;     \treturn self.gas.meanMolarMass()\n&gt; \n&gt; I then created a file write.py that can be called to write the \noutput to\n&gt; comma-delimited files.\n&gt; \n&gt; def csvwrite(filename,f,gas):\n&gt; \tz = f.flow.grid()\n&gt; \tT = f.T()\n&gt; \tu = f.u()\t\n&gt; \tV = f.V()\n&gt; \tfcsv = open(filename+&#39;.csv&#39;,&#39;w&#39;)\n&gt; \twriteCSV(fcsv, [&#39;z (m)&#39;, &#39;u (m/s)&#39;, &#39;V (1/s)&#39;, &#39;T \n(K)&#39;, &#39;density\n&gt; [kg/m^3]&#39;, &#39;Mean Mol.

I need to know the thermal conductivity at each grid\n&gt; point.  The command, thermalConductivity(gas) returns the thermal\n&gt; conductivity of the gas at the final grid point.  The command, \nsolution\n&gt; (fl, &#39;flow&#39;, thermalConductivity(gas)) returns a list containing the\n&gt; correct number of entries, but they are not even close to the \ncorrect\n&gt; values (the first point is 500, and most of the rest are 0).  My\n&gt; ultimate goal is to write a csv file containing the velocity,\n&gt; temperature, and thermal conductivity profiles.  This is easy on \nPython,\n&gt; but I still have not figured out how to import solutions into \npython to\n&gt; use as an initial guess.  Does anyone know how to get the thermal\n&gt; conductivity at each grid point in Matlab, or how to import \nsolutions as\n&gt; initial guesses in Python?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much for any help you can offer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff Miller\n&gt; \n&gt; Colorado School of Mines Engineering\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
