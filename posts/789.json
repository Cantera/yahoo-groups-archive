The Jacobian size scales with (number of reactors)^2. This \nis required to correctly handle the couplings between reactors.\n\nIf the reactors can be grouped into subnetworks that are weakly \ncoupled, it may be possible to put each subnetwork in a separate \nReactorNet object, and loop over the set of subnetworks, advancing each \none through a small timestep.  Not that any couplings between reactors \nin different subnetworks would only be evaluated  for the fixed reactor \nconditions of that timestep, so you would have to make the timestep \nsmall enough to resolve these couplings.\n\nThe Reactor and ReactorNet objects may not be optimal for your \napplication. They were not written with the idea of using them within \nCFD codes.  If they work for your application, that&#39;s great, but if \nthey are too slow you might want to write the solver or integrator for \nthe relevant system of equations yourself, and use Cantera just to \nevaluate thermo properties and reaction rates in your equations.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn May 13, 2005, at 9:21 AM, gdibildox wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I need to build a large network of reactors but I am concerned about\n&gt; the CPU\n&gt; time it takes to run a simple reactor network Cantera file.

The\n&gt; purpose of the\n&gt; &quot;network&quot; is so I can use sim.advance(tau) and have all of the\n&gt; reactors evolve at\n&gt; once.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
