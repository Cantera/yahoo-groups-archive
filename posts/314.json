I have now \nfixed this.  The problem may not have had anything to do with spaces \nafter the commas after all.\n\nI&#39;m sorry that this bug wasn&#39;t caught earlier.  When using a string to \nspecify the composition, I virtually always set mole fractions, and so \nthis bug went undetected,. The corresponding function to set mole \nfractions from a string does not have this problem.\n\nThe fix has already been made in the CVS repository. I&#39;ll release a new \nbinary installer for Windows in a couple of days with this fix along \nwith fixes to the other problems that have been mentioned in messages \nrecently.  Some significant new capabilities will be present too.\n\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n"}}
