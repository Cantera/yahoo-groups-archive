It works now.\n\nFurther question:\n\nSome of the reactions in the kinetic\nscheme are tagged with [options = &#39;duplicate&#39;].\nThese reactions appear twice but with different\nkinetic parameters. Why is this? When I look\nat the kinetic scheme (H2-O2-N2-Ar) by Marinov, Westbrook & Pitz,\nthere are no duplicate reactions.\n\nArief\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Arief,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (1) why are there no thermodynamic and reaction\n&gt; &gt; data in it, as in the case of h2o2.xml?\n&gt; \n&gt; In the file I sent you, I prefaced the species entry \nwith &quot;gri30: &quot;, \n&gt; and also the reactions entry.  This means that Cantera will look \nfor \n&gt; these species / reactions in file gri30.xml, instead of in the \nlocal \n&gt; file.  The gri30.xml file comes with Cantera.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) what is the role of the file h2o2.xml? Is\n&gt; &gt; it an output file, or is it being used during the\n&gt; &gt; flame calculations?\n&gt; \n&gt; When Cantera reads a .cti input file, it first converts it to \nanother \n&gt; format and gives it the extension .xml.  The xml file is then read \nto \n&gt; build the objects used in the application program.  You can regard \nthe \n&gt; .xml file as an internal intermediate file that you don&#39;t have to \nworry \n&gt; about.  Alternatively, once you have created the xml file, you can \nuse \n&gt; it in place of the cti file in your program.  This is useful if \nyou \n&gt; want to run Cantera on a machine that does not have Python \ninstalled, \n&gt; since Python is required to do the cti -&gt; xml conversion but not \nto \n&gt; read the xml file.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (3) I modified the file h2o2.cti, such that it contains\n&gt; &gt; ideal_gas(name = &quot;ohmech&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;       elements = &quot; O  H  Ar  N &quot;,\n&gt; &gt;       species = &quot;&quot;&quot; H2  H  O  O2  OH  H2O  HO2  H2O2  AR  N2 &quot;&quot;&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;       reactions = &quot;all&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;       transport = &quot;Mix&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;       initial_state = state(temperature = 300.0,\n&gt; &gt;       pressure = OneAtm)    ).\n&gt; &gt; However, when I perform the flame calculation I get\n&gt; &gt; the error message species &quot;N2&quot; unknown. Why do I get\n&gt; &gt; this error mesage?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Because it is looking for a definition of species &quot;N2&quot; in the \nlocal \n&gt; file, but not finding one.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; PS. To replace AR by N2 I redefined AR in the .cti file,\n&gt; &gt; such that it contains 2 nitrogen atoms and accompanying\n&gt; &gt; physical data. This seems to work.\n&gt; That works. Or you can just add a species entry for N2 in addition \nto \n&gt; AR.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Dave\n\n\n\n"}}
