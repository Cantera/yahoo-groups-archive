A colleague told me about Cantera, and described it as a \npowerful dev=\r\nice for reactors modeling: I downloaded it immediately!\n\nAs I am intended t=\r\no implement a kinetic model for biomass \ngasification, I would like to unde=\r\nrstand what is the best way to do \nit, and which functions may I re-utilize=\r\n among the many in the \nCantera toolbox. \n\nThe problem is: I would like to =\r\nconstruct a 1 dimensional model able \nto reproduce the temperature, velocit=\r\ny and composition profiles along \nthe axis of the reactor as the gas flows =\r\nthrough the active surface \nof charcoal. Should I use a single reactor cont=\r\naining ODE solution \nalong the axial co-ordinate or should I link many 0-D =\r\nreactors \ntogether?\nWhat about chemical reactions modeling? Mainly, the mod=\r\nel should work \nwith the following reactions:\n\nC+2H2&lt;=3D&gt;CH4 ; C+CO2&lt;=3D&gt;2C=\r\nO; C+H2O&lt;=3D&gt;CO+H2; CH4+H2O&lt;=3D&gt;CO+3H2\n\nIs there in the Cantera tools a kin=\r\netic model for these reactions?\n\nMoreover, is there something that I can us=\r\ne to implement a model of \nbiomass pyrolysis?\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nLo=\r\nrenzo\n\n\n"}}
