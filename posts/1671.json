It shoul=\r\nd be simply removed.\n2.\tRefine.cpp. It is not a bug but m_min_range should =\r\nnot be \nhardcoded, default value 0.01 is too high. This parameter should be=\r\n \nmain criterion for rejecting refining the grid for components with \nalmos=\r\nt constant concentrations. I changed the default value to 0.05. \n3.\tStFlow.=\r\ncpp. Incorrect formula for gradlogT. It should be  \ngradlogT =3D 2.0*(T(x,m=\r\n+1) - T(x,m))/(T(x,m+1) + T(x,m))/(z(m+1)-z(m))\n4.\tStFlow.cpp. To avoid cra=\r\nsh after refining the following line \nshould be added in StFlow::resize(..)=\r\n subroutine:\nm_dthermal.resize(m_nsp, m_points).\n\nIn conclusion, I repeat a=\r\ngain that it would be much better to fix \nthese bugs in the distribution co=\r\nde.\n\nBest regards, Anatoli\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;laurent_benez=\r\nech&quot; &lt;benezech@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Good morning Anatoli,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Would it be pos=\r\nsible for you to post a message with the detailed \nlist\n&gt; of the changes th=\r\nat you brought to the Cantera source code, in order\n&gt; to use the Soret effe=\r\nct ?\n&gt; I would really appreciate.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thank you in advance,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best re=\r\ngards\n&gt; \n&gt; Laurent\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;avmokhov&quot; &lt;avmokho=\r\nv@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I succeded in calculating 1-D fl=\r\name with the Soret \neffect. To \n&gt; &gt; do this I fixed a few bugs in the Refin=\r\ne.cpp and StFlow.cpp \nfiles. I \n&gt; &gt; think that it would be not very bad ide=\r\na to fix these bugs in the \n&gt; &gt; Cantera distribution as well. What&#39;s  a sta=\r\nndard procedure for \n&gt; &gt; submitting and correcting bugs in the Cantera?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Best regards, \n&gt; &gt; Anatoli Mokhov\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
