I would \n&gt; like to enlist a few interested people to help with the logistics and \n&gt; planning. I will be contacting some of you who have volunteered your \n&gt; services for this in a few days.  The time, location, duration, and \n&gt; agenda are all to be determined.  My inclination is to make it a \n&gt; half-day workshop, but nothing has been decided yet. Stay tuned for \n&gt; more details...\n&gt; \n\n\nHi David,\n\nMay we have some precisions according to the workshop organisation, so\nthat we can &quot;force&quot; our administration to support us for the meeting?\n\nCongratulations for the great job done so far.\n\nBest regards\n\nChristophe MATIGNON\n\n\n"}}
