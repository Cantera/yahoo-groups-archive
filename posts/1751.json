However, the\ntemperature of the entering species in known(propane-air m=\r\nixture at\nstoichiometric proportions at 298 K).With the initial guess of re=\r\nactor\ntemperature to be 1700K, I get the results, which differ considerably=\r\n\nfrom the results obtained without cantera, involving assumptions of a\nsimp=\r\nle chemical reaction. other conditions are;\ni)No mass and heat transfer at =\r\nthe wall.\n\nFor example, some results obtained are:\nmass flow rate(kg/sec)  =\r\n    Texit(calculated)(K)     T(cantera)\n0.1                           2400 =\r\n                   1964\n0.2                           2297                 =\r\n   1959\n\nI would be very grateful if you could look into the details and\nsu=\r\nggest some solution.Moreover, is there any way to model PFR in cantera.\n\nwa=\r\niting for your response.\n\nsincerely,\n\nDeep Gupta\n\nattached here is the prog=\r\nram which i am using for cantera;\n\nclear all;\ngas=3DGRI30;\nset(gas,&#39;T&#39;,298,=\r\n&#39;P&#39;,oneatm,&#39;X&#39;,&#39;C3H8:1,N2:18.8,O2:5&#39;);\n\n%creating an upstream object\nupstre=\r\nam=3D Reservoir(gas);\nmdot =3D 0.1;   % kg/s%\nmfc =3D MassFlowController;\ni=\r\nnstall(mfc, upstream, r);%connecting to the reactor\nsetMassFlowRate(mfc, md=\r\not);\n\n\n%creating a reactor object\nset(gas,&#39;T&#39;,1700,&#39;P&#39;,oneatm);\nr=3DReactor=\r\n(gas);\nsetInitialVolume(r, 2.68*1.0e-4);\n\n%creating a downstream object\ndow=\r\nnstream =3D Reservoir(gas);\nmfc2 =3D MassFlowController;\ninstall(mfc2, r, d=\r\nownstream);\nsetMassFlowRate(mfc2, mdot);\n\n\nnetwork=3DReactorNet({r});\nt =3D=\r\n 0.0;\ndt =3D0.1;\nn=3D1;\ntemp(1)=3Dtemperature(r);\ntemp(2)=3Dtemp(1)+0.1;\nt(=\r\n1)=3D0;\nwhile(abs(temp(n)-temp(n+1))&gt;10^(-3))\n       t(n+1) =3D t(n) + dt;\n=\r\n        n=3Dn+1;     \n  advance(network, t(n));\n  temp(n+1) =3D temperature=\r\n(r);\n   end\ntemp(n+1)\n\n\n"}}
