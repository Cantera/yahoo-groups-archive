This message \nis just to let you know what is coming....\n\n\n1. Transport properties. As alluded to in the previous messages, a \nmulticomponent transport package will be added soon. The plan is to \neventually implement several interchangable transport modules, from \nsimple ones for quick work to multicomponent transport for accurate \ncalculations. The first one will be a multicomponent transport \npackage that nominally implements the expressions published in the \nSandia report (SAND86-8246) by Kee et al. which were implemented in \nthe Chemkin &quot;TRANLIB&quot; transport library. Of course, as always this is \nbeing implemented in open-source C++. Actually, a portion of the \npackage is already integrated into Cantera. If you have the CVS \nversion of Cantera, update your working copy, and then the following \nC++ fragment should work:\n\n\n....\nCKGas gas(&quot;chem.inp&quot;, &quot;therm.dat&quot;);\ngas.inititializeTransport(&quot;tran.dat&quot;);\n....\ncout &lt;&lt; gas.viscosity();     /* print the viscosity in Pa-s */\n\n\nThe files are property databases in the usual Chemkin-compatible \nformat. So far only the viscosity implementation is finished, but the \nrest will follow soon. \n\n\n2. Linked stirred reactor models. Classes for stirred reactors are \nworking now and will be available next week. These simuulate full \ntransient behavior, are not restricted to ideal gases, and may be \nlinked to other stirred reactors through flow controllers (mass flow \ncontrollers, pressure regulators, etc.).  By combining the \nappropriate components, you can build everything from a simple \nconstant-pressure CSTR to an engine simulator. This will initially \nonly be available in C++; at some point it will be added to the \nPython package too.\n\n\n3. A Chemkin mechanism to C++ converter. Considerable performance \ngains are possible by hard-coding a reaction mechanism in Fortran, C, \nor C++. Cantera will soon have the capability to read in a Chemkin-\nformat file and write out C++ source code for a Cantera-compatible \nC++ class that hardwires a particular mechanism. Due to its \nwidespread popularity, a fast version of GRI-Mech 3.0 will be built \ninto Cantera in this way.\n\n\n4. An updated manual. The documentation still leaves much to be \ndesired, but is improving. An update to the manual will be available \nsoon that will hopefully not have the printing problems some have \nexperienced. Also, the on-line C++ code documentation is slowly being \nfleshed out, and will be available also as a reference manual (PDF).\n\n\nAs always, feedback is welcome. I would be interested to know how you \nare using or plan to use Cantera, etc. Also, if you are interested in \nhelping with Cantera development, contact me - there is always plenty \nto do.\n\nDave Goodwin\n\n\n[p.s. - if you don&#39;t want to receive these e-mails, you can elect to \nreceive a periodic digest, or to not receive any messages.
