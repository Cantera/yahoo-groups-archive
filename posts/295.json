I am very \nfamilliar with c/c++ and I like the approach that you are using with \ncantera.  I have been trying to setup a kinetics problem utilizing a \nValve object.  Is there something about its implementation that \nrequires something different that MassFlowController objects?  I can \nuse these but get a segmentation violation whenever I use a Valve. \nI have checked your documentation but cannot seem to find any \ninformation that is of help with this subject. \n \nDarin S.
