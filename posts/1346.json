This effect will be more  \npronounced at low pressure and slow velocities.  The flame conditions  \nin script flame1.py are not too realistic, and probably this example  \nshould be changed to correspond to a more &quot;normal&quot; flame.  But there  \nis nothing wrong with the physics.\n\n\nOn Oct 21, 2006, at 4:36 AM, hdoe71 wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; running the flame1.py burner stabilized flame simulation I recognized\n&gt; that the concentration of H2O (water) is at z=0 about a third of the\n&gt; final concentration, a  little depending on the pressure. From my\n&gt; knowledge of mass balancing the initial concentration must be 0 for\n&gt; water, and the concentrations at z=0 unequal to zero should be only\n&gt; those of the educts hydrogen, oxygen and the inertial gas argon.\n&gt; I&#39;ve used the unaltered script flame1.py of cantera-1.6.0, varied only\n&gt; the pressure within 0.03-1 atm. A similar behaviour is observable for\n&gt; CK II running premixed H2-O2-Ar flames or C2H2-O2-flames, but this is\n&gt; no CK II group, but interesting for me (some form of oo- \n&gt; inheritance?-).\n&gt; Textbooks about combustion (Warnatz et al.) show graphs with initial\n&gt; water concentrations of zero.\n&gt; Is something wrong in my interpretation of the results in flame1.csv?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards from Germany\n&gt;\n&gt; Holger\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
