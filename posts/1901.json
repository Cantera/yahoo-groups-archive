Indeed, for a fre=\r\ne \nhydrogen/air flame Cantera calculates temperatures substantially \nlower =\r\nthan adiabatic ones (difference can be 40 K for a coarse grid). \nIt happens=\r\n when multicomponent transport is used. For a mixture-\naveraged model calcu=\r\nlations are fine. Refining grid helps a little \nbit - difference decreases =\r\ndown to 20 K when number of grid points \napproaches 300. Further refinement=\r\n is impossible: Cantera has \nproblems with the noise when approximating der=\r\nivatives. It seems for \nme that something is nor correct with calculations =\r\nof diffusion \nterms. I did not dig in the code to check equations but it is=\r\n \nprobably due to artificial diffusion on a coarse mesh. What \ndifferences =\r\nare used to approximate derivatives? Windward or central \ndifference?\nBest =\r\nregards, Anatoli\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dave Goodwin&quot; &lt;dgoodwin=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you send me an example flame script or program that =\r\nshows the \nproblem? Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matei I. =\r\nRadulescu&quot; &lt;matei@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When one computes the the free-flame str=\r\nucture (say H2+air at \nPTN),\n&gt; &gt; the equilibrium temperature obtained is di=\r\nfferent from the true\n&gt; &gt; adiabatic flame temperature obtained via a direct=\r\n equilibrium\n&gt; &gt; calculation, using the same thermo data.  The differences =\r\nare on \nthe\n&gt; &gt; order of 10K for the example given.  Likewise, the enthalpy=\r\n in the\n&gt; &gt; flame of the equilibrium products is NOT found equal to reactan=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt; enthalpy, although theoretically, they should be equal.  This \nleads=\r\n me\n&gt; &gt; to suspect that the non-conservative flame calculations introduces\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; order 1 errors in the species concentrations of the products,\n&gt; &gt; consi=\r\nstent with the results of the simulations!
