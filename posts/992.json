I do however wonder if somone has compiled a \n&gt; reference manual or user&#39;s guide specifically for the Matlab \n&gt; interface. A quick reference guide e.g a list of \n&gt; functions/methods/objects would also do the job.\n\nI don&#39;t know of such a reference manual offhand (there may be one), \nbut a simple way to get a list of objects is to look in the Cantera \ntoolbox directory at the names of the directories that start with &quot;@&quot;. \n (There&#39;s also a Contents.m file in there which may be useful to look \nat.)  Then, you can get a list of methods for the objects either with \nMatlabs &quot;methods&quot; function, or by looking in the object directories.\n\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
