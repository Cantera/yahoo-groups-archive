The CVS repository has been updated, as has the on-line \nC++ source code documentation. See classes Transport, \nTransportFactory, and MultiTransport.\n\nA Fortran interface (mtlib) has also been implemented that has an \ninterface very similar to the Chemkin TRANLIB library. The \ncombination of ctlib/mtlib can be used to port most Chemkin-based \nreacting flow programs to Cantera.\n\nA binary version of these libraries for Windows may be found in \nthe &#39;files&#39; section of the user&#39;s group. Get file win_ctlib.zip, \nunzip it, read README.txt, and follow the procedure described there. \nThe code is contained a DLL file, and linking to it should be \nstraightforward. You do not need a C++ compiler to use this, but will \nneed Compaq Visual Fortran (CVF) or another Fortran compiler \ncompatible with CVF. Fortran applications should build &quot;out of the \nbox,&quot; with no special handling of mixed-language programming required \non your part. (This is handled by INTERFACE specifications in Fortran \n90 module files ctlib.f and mtlib.f.)\n\nNote also that a few things are missing, notably mixture-averaged \nconductivity and diffusion coefficients. These will be added very \nsoon.\n\nI will be out next week, but welcome your questions/comments if you \nhave a chance to try this out.\n\nDave Goodwin\n\n\n  \n\n\n"}}
