My =\r\ngas\nphase species (idealgas mix) involve combustion products and halogens.\n=\r\nThere are more than 40 species in liquid phase (I had to define each\nas sto=\r\nichiometric liquid) and about 10 solid phase species (each\ndefined as stoic=\r\nhiometric solid).\n\nWhen I use multiphase equilibrium, the answer is differe=\r\nnt from that\nfrom popular HSC Chemistry 5.1 program. Has anyone encountered=\r\n this\nproblem? Please let me know if you have successfully used a three\npha=\r\nse equilibrium solver and compared to HSC or other multiphase\nequilibrium s=\r\nolvers.\n\nMy code uses &#39;importPhases&#39;and Mixture(phases) to import all phase=\r\ns\nand species.\n\nThank you,\nChitral\n\n\n\n"}}
