Nevertheless, if I use large  \n&gt; mechanisms I\n&gt; can only see the first 20-40 reactions depending on my screen  \n&gt; resolution. Would it\n&gt; be possible to include a scroll function in this window in a future  \n&gt; release of\n&gt; Mixmaster?\n&gt;\n&gt; Furthermore, I have a Cantera_work directory on my linux box, where I  \n&gt; keep all\n&gt; files from my simulations, but when I use Mixmaster, the program tend  \n&gt; to dump all\n&gt; the files it creates during a run in the root of my home directory.  \n&gt; Would it be\n&gt; possible to make Mixmaster dump it&#39;s files in the directory where a  \n&gt; data file is\n&gt; loaded from in a future release of Mixmaster?\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, just a minor detail. In the Help -&gt; About Cantera... there is  \n&gt; no pop-up\n&gt; window. When I run Mixmaster on a windows XP machine I get several  \n&gt; error\n&gt; messages when I press the About Cantera..., and on one occasion it  \n&gt; crashed\n&gt; python.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s all\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Martin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
