I can not \nfigure out how to use data from nasa.cti without pasting the data I \nwant into a new cti file.  Another student here using Cantera told me \nthat in the equil demo, all he had to do was replace gri30.cti with \nnasa.cti and it worked fine.  When I try this, I get the following \nerror:\n\nProcedure: xml_findByName\nError:   name phase not found\n\nError in ==&gt; XML_Node.findByName at 4\nindex = ctmethods(10, 9, root.id, name);\n\nError in ==&gt; Solution.Solution at 32\n  node = findByName(doc,&#39;phase&#39;);\n\nError in ==&gt; IdealGasMix at 39\n       s = Solution(a);\n\nError in ==&gt; equiltest at 12\n   gas = IdealGasMix(&#39;nasa.cti&#39;);\n\nI made sure that nasa.cti and gri30.cti are in the same directory, \nand I checked to make sure that the species I am using have entries \nin nasa.cti.  What could be the problem?\n\nThank you very much for your help,\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n"}}
