This includes \ntime-dependent cool flames for lower temperature hydrocarbons, with \nmany outstanding experiments from Pier-Giorgio Lignola and others, as \nwell as higher temperature time-dependent, periodic ignition \nexperiments from Phil Malte&#39;s group at U Washington.  There are lot \nmore from others as well.\n\nBoth Chemkin and HCT were adapted quite a long time ago to solve the \nnumerical problem that Ulf suggests, not so much to accelerate \nsolution of the steady-state problem as to address time-dependent \nstirred reactor applications.  HCT solves the time-independent \nproblem as the long-time, steady solution of the time-dependent \nproblem, just as it solves the steady flame propagation problem as \nthe long-time solution of the unsteady problem.  In principle, he \ncould use the flame code and ask for only one spatial zone, with \nspecified input fluxes of reactant concentrations and a zero pressure \ngradient as the boundary conditions at the other boundary.\n\nI don&#39;t know if there is any documentation of the Chemkin version of \nthis problem, and as usual, no documentation exists for the HCT \nimplementatio except in the half-dozen or so papers we have written \nusing the feature.\n\nCharlie Westbrook\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Ulf,\n&gt;\n&gt;Something like that could probably be done.  The reason it is slow is\n&gt;that the algorithm uses a full, nomerically-computed Jacobian. This\n&gt;means that all reactors in a network are assumed to be strongly coupled\n&gt;to one another.  For many networks, this is not the case, and the\n&gt;Jacobian is actually sparse.  Modifying the Jacobian evaluation\n&gt;procedures in CVODE to take advantage of the structure of the Jacobian\n&gt;would probably go a long way toward boosting speed.\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Jun 3, 2005, at 4:10 AM, usenechal wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Dear Dave,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  is it possible to use the solver for spatial onedim-problems to solve\n&gt;&gt;  continously stirred reactors with time as the dimension instead of\n&gt;&gt;  space ? What should be done to implement this ? I think the method you\n&gt;&gt;  described (with an iteration over an plug flow reactor) could be\n&gt;&gt;  improved in speed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  best regards\n&gt;&gt;  ulf\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Yahoo!
