I believe that it will be a very \npowe=\r\nrful tool, but I think I&#39;m having trouble using it to it&#39;s full \ncapabiliti=\r\nes.  I&#39;ve learned quite a bit by looking at the Demos and \nTutorials that c=\r\name with the windows distribution of cantera (with \nPython).  I&#39;ve figured =\r\nout how to use the reactor module to simulate a \ntransient CSTR.  At the mo=\r\nment I&#39;m only interested in the steady state \nsolution to a problem.  It&#39;s =\r\na fairly simple matter to allow the \ntransient CSTR problem to go to a stea=\r\ndy state, but this seems like a \nwaste of computation time.  Is there a way=\r\n to model a steady state CSTR \ndirectly in Cantera?\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n"}}
