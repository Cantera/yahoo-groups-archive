As it stands, this is only possible in pyt=\r\nhon \nfor now. two more questions: Is that the sensitivity of a given \nreact=\r\nion rate to the concentration of a chosen species in the \nreaction? e.g.d/d=\r\nk1([OH]) where the species is OH and the reaction is \nthe first in the mech=\r\nanism? \nI guess this is so. To use this technique to probe the chemistry of=\r\n a \nmechanism would then require some foreknowledge of the species to \ncons=\r\nider.\n\nsecond question: almost not related to the first. How do I get eithe=\r\nr \nMatlab or Python to output the rate data like A, n, E. In matlab &#39;rop&#39;\n,=\r\n rate of creation etc, just give numerical values and not the data. \n\nThank=\r\ns for any help.\nben\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, Dave Goodwin &lt;dgo=\r\nodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Check out the Python demo sensitivity1.py in demos/py=\r\nthon/reactors.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 20, 2007, at 10:14 PM, ben akih kumgeh wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just wondering if anyone knows how the sensitivit=\r\ny analysis is \ncarried\n&gt; &gt; out the above function/(method?) is called.
