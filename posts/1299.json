I am on vacation  \nand for the last few days I have not had internet access.\n\nThis error message usually means that you are starting from an  \ninitial solution estimate that is unreasonable in some way. For  \nexample, starting a combustion simulation with only radicals could  \nlead to this error, since the destruction rates are so rapid that the  \nsolver can&#39;t find any reasonable time step.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether you are re-initializing the  \nsolver for each Fluent timestep. Usually you need to call CVInit or  \nCVReinit at the beginning of each time step, because Fluent may have  \naltered the solution vector in ways that CVode doesn&#39;t know about.   \nIn my own application codes that do something similar to what you are  \ndescribing, I have found for some reason that CVReinit doesn&#39;t work  \n(this is probably dependent on the CVode version) so I use CVInit.  \nThis slows down the code a bit due to unnecessary memory allocation/ \ndeallocation, but works for me.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Aug 11, 2006, at 8:16 AM, danielexr wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi, professor Goodwin.\n&gt; I&#39;m simulating a channel of automotive catalytic converter.\n&gt; I&#39;m studying the fluidynamics of the channel through Fluent 6.2.16,\n&gt; Linux, and for each face of the channel wall it&#39;s called Cantera, from\n&gt; fluent&#39;s &quot;udf&quot;, looping over wall faces.\n&gt; I modeled the surface reactions with an &quot;interface kinetics&quot;.\n&gt; I&#39;m sending as input for the Cantera module: temperature of gas and\n&gt; wall, the species concentrations Yi  and the coverages of rhodium and\n&gt; platinum.\n&gt; I do advanceCoverages(dt) with dt=1, that is a time advance long\n&gt; enough to get the equilibrium.\n&gt; Sometimes, for some settings of inputs, i get the error message\n&gt; &quot;..failed repeatedly or with |h| = hmin&quot;, when the Cantera function is\n&gt; called automatically by fluent.\n&gt; But, if i try to manually run the Cantera function with the same\n&gt; inputs, i don&#39;t get the error.\n&gt; Can you help me, please?
