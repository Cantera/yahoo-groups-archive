The config.h \nwas missing from C:&#92;cantera-1.5.3&#92;Cantera&#92;src and this was what was \ncausing the error.  After sucessfully installing building all the \nfiles using Visual Studio i then went to the cygwin window and \ntyped &#39;make win&#39; to build the phython interface and Matlab toolboxes.\nThe file from build/include/cantera were sucessfully built but when \ncygwin changed directorires to Cantera/python is got the following \nerrors:\n\ncd Cantera/python; make win\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/c/Documents and Settings/Sean \nHenderson/Desktop/New Folder/cantera-1.5.3/Cantera/python&#39;\nmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `and&#39;, needed by `_winbuild&#39;.  \nStop.\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/Documents and Settings/Sean \nHenderson/Desktop/New Folder/cantera-1.5.3/Cantera/python&#39;\nmake: *** [python] Error 2\n\nIt appears that I am missing a files in the Cantera/python folder.  \nBy the way the make &#39;make win&#39; command in cygwin was done in the \nfolder where the source code was extracted from the .zip file and \nnot from C:Cantera-1.5.3 where the project was built using Visual \nStudio.  Did i make a mistake in installing Cantera or is there \nanother type of error.  Any help would be greatly appriciated.\n\nThank You,\nSean\n\n\n"}}
