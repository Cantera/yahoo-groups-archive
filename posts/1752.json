Is it a problem that I have 64-bit machine and Windows?\nYes it is a problem. Has anyone gotten Cantera running on a 64-bit  \nWindows machine? The Windows binary installer is currently made on a  \n32-bit machine.\n\n&gt; 2. If I install old nummaray do I need install numpy for scipy?\nNo.\n\n&gt; 3. On which platform (matlab, python or maybe c++) Cantera is most\n&gt; user friendly code?\nWell, that is a matter of opinion.  I prefer using Python over  \nMATLAB, but MATLAB does have quite a few useful features.  My basic  \nmotto is &quot;Use Python or MATLAB if possible, otherwise use C++&quot;.\n\n&gt; 4. Do you have some articles about using Cantera in detonation\n&gt; (symposiums, conferences)? Could you send me on e-mail\n&gt; kamil_sobczak@... ?\nProf. Joe Shepherd here at Caltech has developed a detonation toolkit  \nthat sits on top of Cantera.  I would recommend contacting him.\n\n&gt;\nBest Wishes,\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
