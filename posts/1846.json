If the mixture  composition does not change, every \nther=\r\nmodynamic function is a function of two parameters. Thus you can \ncalculate=\r\n partial derivative over one parameter when other parameter \nis kept consta=\r\nnt. For example, for the energy, partial derivative \nover temperature at co=\r\nnstant volume is Cv. AFAIK calculating partial \nderivative of arbitrary the=\r\nrmodynamic parameter is not (yet) \nimplemented in Cantera. As a very simple=\r\n workaround I propose you to \ncalculate in Cantera the energy as a function=\r\n of temperature at fixed \npressure and other way round with a reasonable st=\r\nep and then use a \nspreadsheet or Matlab to calculate derivatives. Some fin=\r\ne point is \nwhat type of derivatives do you want to calculate =96 frozen or=\r\n \nequlibrium? If you want to calculate equilibrium derivatives, than \nyou n=\r\need to calculate equilibrium composition on every step, while \nwhen calcula=\r\nting &quot;frozen&quot; derivatives the composition should be kept \nconstant (&quot;frozen=\r\n).\nHope that this helps.\nAnatoli \n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Peter P=\r\nerez&quot; &lt;plpd00@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if anyone has tried calcula=\r\nting the derivatives of the \n&gt; thermodynamic properties from Cantera. I nee=\r\nd to compute \nderivatives \n&gt; respect to T and P for the internal energy, i.=\r\ne., du/dT and du/dp. \nI \n&gt; would appreciate any advice in this direction. I=\r\n am using the \nCantera \n&gt; toolbox in Matlab 7. Thank you very much for your=\r\n attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
