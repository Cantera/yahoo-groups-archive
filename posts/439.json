For the reaction you \ncite, specify it as\n\n2 CH4 + 3 O2 =&gt; 2 CO + 4 H2O\n\nThen cut the pre-exponential term in the rate expression by two, since \nas written here this reaction consumes two CH4, instead of 1, as \noriginally written.  Since you are specifying the reaction orders for \nthe reactants, the stoichiometric coefficients will not be used in \ncomputing the reaction rate of progress, only in converting from rate \nof progress to species production rates.\n\nCantera requires integer stoichiometric coefficients since this allows \nusing some faster numerical algorithms and there is no loss of \ngenerality, since every balanced reaction can be written with integer \nstoichiometric coefficients.  In particular, species production rates \nare computed from the reaction rates of progress using integer addition \noperations, instead of floating-point multiplies. Also, except when a \nreaction order is explicitly specified (as in this reaction), rates of \nprogress are computed using integer multiply operations, instead of \nfloating-point exponentiation.   All of this turns out to make a big \ndifference in the performance using large mechanisms, and is one main \nreason that flame calculations, for example, are often faster with \nCantera than with &quot;other well-known software packages.&quot;  (There are \nother reasons, too.)\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jul 6, 2004, at 7:32 AM, kvirgilm wrote:\n\n&gt; I am trying to implement a &#39;global&#39; mechanism for the gas phase \n&gt; reactions.\n&gt; I am specifying the reactions as such in the cti file:\n&gt;\n&gt; reaction( &quot; CH4 + 1.5 O2 =&gt; CO + 2 H2O &quot;, [5.3044e8, 0.1902, 13940.0], \n&gt; order\n&gt; = &quot;CH4:0.587917 O2:0.620861&quot;)\n&gt;\n&gt; When I go to convert it to xml, I get the error:\n&gt;\n&gt; cti2ctml methane-3step.cti\n&gt; Traceback (most recent call last):\n&gt;   File &quot;./.cttmp.py&quot;, line 7, in ?\n&gt;     execfile(file)\n&gt;   File &quot;./methane-3step.cti&quot;, line 98, in ?\n&gt;     reaction( &quot; CH4 + 1.5 O2 =&gt; CO + 2 H2O &quot;, [5.3044e8, 0.1902, \n&gt; 13940.0],\n&gt; order = &quot;CH4:0.587917 O2:0.620861&quot;)\n&gt;   File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/ctml_writer.py&quot;, line 643, in \n&gt; __init__\n&gt;     self._r = getReactionSpecies(r)\n&gt;   File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/ctml_writer.py&quot;, line 323, in\n&gt; getReactionSpecies\n&gt;     n = int(t)\n&gt; ValueError: invalid literal for int(): 1.5\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a simple fix to allow for non-integer stoichiometric \n&gt; coefficients?
