I have run=\r\n across what I\nbelieve to be an inconsistency in the specification of time-=\r\nstepping and\nsteady-state tolerances.  From my understanding, the time-step=\r\nping\ntolerances should only control the time-stepping portion of the solver=\r\n,\nwhile the steady-state tolerances will determine the accuracy of the\nsolu=\r\ntion with the Newton solver.  However, if I run the simulation\ntwice, chang=\r\ning only the time-stepping tolerances, I end up with a\ndifferent steady-sta=\r\nte solution.  The case with the &quot;looser&quot;\ntime-stepping tolerances converges=\r\n much quicker.  If I do the same\nthing, but change only the steady-state to=\r\nlerances, the final solutions\nare the same and the solution takes basically=\r\n the same time.  \n\nFrom these tests, I think that all tolerances in the pro=\r\nblem are being\nset equal to the time-stepping tolerances, and specifying th=\r\ne\nsteady-state tolerances has no effect.  I am running the simulations\nusin=\r\ng python.  I have followed the path of the f.set(tol =3D tol_ss,\ntol_time =\r\n=3D tol_ts) command from StagnationFlow.py through onedim.py to\nDomain1D.h.=\r\n  However, I cannot see where the source of the problem is.\n\nIt appears to =\r\nbe a more general problem than the StagnationFlow class\nand could affect al=\r\nl one-dimensional simulations.\n\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciat=\r\ned.\n\nHappy New Year,\n\nJeffrey M.
