You can access it at\n&gt;http://blue.caltech.edu/cantera.pdf. Like Cantera itself, the manual\n&gt;is a work in progress, and is subject to change...\n&gt;\n&gt;A number of you have e-mailed me with various questions, problems,\n&gt;etc. I am happy to answer all e-mail correspondence, but I would\n&gt;encourage you to post these messages here if the topic is potentially\n&gt;of interest to others. If you are having problems with something, it\n&gt;is likely someone else is too. I get an e-mail message from Yahoo as\n&gt;soon as any message is posted, so my reply will be no slower than if\n&gt;you e-mail me directly.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m interested in hearing the comments of anyone who has tried to\n&gt;download, install, and use Cantera. Have you tried the Python\n&gt;interface? Or CtLib? How did they work? etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;A final note: much of the Cantera web site will be down tomorrow\n&gt;morning due to a necessary power shutdown in the building housing the\n&gt;host machines. Should be up by noon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;cantera-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
