I \nam pretty sure I followed the directions correctly and created the \ncorrect environmental variable paths.  However, when I try to run one \nof the matlab demos, matlab doesn&#39;t recognize any of the terms in the \ndemo files.  Any suggestions?  The directions I followed are at \nhttp://thermo.ece.olin.edu/Cantera.shtml.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
