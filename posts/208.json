The a5 term  \nshould be divided by T, and there should be a &#39;+&#39; sign between the  \nquadratic and cubic terms. This problem only affects the documentation,  \nhowever - it is implemented correctly in the code. The coefficients in  \na &#39;cti&#39; NASA entry should be identical to those in a Chemkin-style  \nthermo database entry. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Thursday, October 23, 2003, at 05:04 AM, Houston Miller wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We have been playing with the opposed diffusion flame code (Very\n&gt; impressive!) and wish to apply it to some methane flame-doping  \n&gt; experiments\n&gt; that we are doing.  For this, we need to add several new species for  \n&gt; which\n&gt; thermo and transport data is fleeting.  I am using  group additivity   \n&gt; data\n&gt; to estimate thermo properties.  I am now at the point of trying to add  \n&gt; NASA\n&gt; coefficients into the &quot;cti&quot; file we are creating.  The problem is that  \n&gt; I am\n&gt; a bit confused about the form for the enthalpy that goes into the  \n&gt; file.  The\n&gt; documentation (cti.pdf, Eqn. 4.2) suggests a slightly different form  \n&gt; than\n&gt; the old Chemkin-II approach.  (In particular, should the sixth  \n&gt; coefficient\n&gt; be divided by temperature.) I have started to reverse engineer by  \n&gt; running\n&gt; through the same process with a known molecule, but I thought it might  \n&gt; be\n&gt; both more efficient to ask you, and clarify this for others as well.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
