It&#39;s great to code in Visual Studio and\nC++. This lastest build has renewed by interest in CANTERA (was limited to\npython before).\n\nI am trying to develope a combustor simulation with multiple reactors and am\nhaving trouble lighting them all at once with a H igniters and the resulting\npressure pulse. Any suggestions for starting multilple combustion reactors at\nonce. I am also having trouble with the correct C++ syntax for\nPressureRegulators. If a reactor has multple inputs, do I need a pressure\nregulator on the output for each one?. Tryied flexible walls but the program\nexited.\n\nMy model has premix,recirulation,primary, secondary, and dilution zone\nreacters. When changing mass flow controller rates during the sim, does the\nReactorNet need resetting each time.\n\nJust Starting but this is really fun !!!! \n\n___________________________________________________\nThe ALL NEW CS2000 from CompuServe\n Better!
