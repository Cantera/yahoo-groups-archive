My colleague is working with C++ =\r\ninterface\n&gt; for Cantera so we may be able to use liquid solution class avai=\r\nlable\n&gt; only in C++ version. Could you please briefly describe the class in=\r\n\n&gt; brief. I am also wondering if this class considers positive and\n&gt; negati=\r\nve ions? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; Chitral \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, D=\r\navid Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Defining each liquid species as a s=\r\ntoichiometric liquid is not \nwant  \n&gt; &gt; you want to do.
