Cantera usually installs fine on \nWindows PCs and everything runs.  Something about your system \nconfiguration must be non-standard, but I don&#39;t know what - some \nenvironment variable setting, for example.  Maybe try undefining both \nTMP and TEMP.  Or see if an older version of Cantera works on your \nsystem.  You could also try installing on someone else&#39;s PC to see if \nit is a problem specific to your machines.  Lots of people install \nCantera using the Windows binary installer without problem, so I don&#39;t \nthink it is anything fundamental in Cantera or in the install \nprocedure...\n\nGood luck,\nDave\n\n\n\n\n  I have installed it on clean PCs and the demos all run without problem.\n\nOn Nov 20, 2004, at 3:58 PM, -Tom wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dr. Goodwin:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am still not able to successfully execute a Cantera demo because of\n&gt; the same error:\n&gt; \tProcedure: ct2ctml\n&gt; \tError:   could not convert input file to CTML\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using WinXP Pro SP2.  Today I also installed Cantera and Python\n&gt; on my old computer running Win 2000.  Running the demos on this\n&gt; machine also failed and indicated the same error.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I did copy the ctml_writer module to the &#39;site_pakages&#92;Cantera&#39;\n&gt; folder and I can now run the &#39;check&#39; script from Python IDLE.  It\n&gt; appeared to execute successfully.  I am also able to run the &#39;cttmp&#39;\n&gt; file from IDLE to generate a &#39;gri30.xml&#39; file.\n&gt;\n&gt; Incidentally, Josh Freeh on Mac Os X denotes a similar error.\n&gt; However, unlike Josh, the error is not resolved when Python is\n&gt; executed from DOS command prompt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for your help,\n&gt; -Tom\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Tom -\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The &#39;check&#39; script is run whenever the &#39;cttmp&#39; script fails, to see\n&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; the problem is with the Cantera installation.  Unfortunately the\n&gt;&gt; single-line &#39;check&#39; script will always fail, since it tries to\n&gt; import\n&gt;&gt; module &#39;ctml_writer&#39; from the Cantera package  (where it used to\n&gt; be),\n&gt;&gt; instead of importing it directly.  The workaround is to copy file\n&gt;&gt; &#39;ctml_writer.py&#39; from the &#39;site_packages&#39; folder in the Python\n&gt; Library\n&gt;&gt; folder to the &#39;Cantera&#39; folder within &#39;site_packages&#39;.   it seems\n&gt; to me\n&gt;&gt; now that running the &#39;check&#39; script is more trouble than it is\n&gt; worth,\n&gt;&gt; and I am removing this step from the procedure followed to\n&gt; translate\n&gt;&gt; input files.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But this does not answer why the cttmp script fails, since it works\n&gt;&gt; when you run it from the command line.  I&#39;m not sure why that is\n&gt;&gt; happening, but it must be some sort of path problem.  Perhaps try\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; above fix and try again and see what happens...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By the way - I assume you are using WinXP or Win2000.  Cantera will\n&gt;&gt; encounter problems under Win98 or WinME.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dave\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
