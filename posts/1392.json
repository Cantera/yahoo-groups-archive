I was able to compile the code using g++ but cannot link\nthe canter=\r\na libraries to code compiled using the compaq cxx compiler.\n    During link=\r\ning, I get undefined references. \n\nI am also trying to compile cantera on 6=\r\n4-bit Itanium (Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux AS release 3 ) with no success thus=\r\n far.\n\nMarc\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vincenzomulone&quot; &lt;vmulone@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone, \n&gt; does anyone have any news on compiling cantera =\r\non 64-bit machines? \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to do that on a 64-bit Alpha one (Red Hat=\r\n Linux 7.0). \n&gt;  \n&gt; First of all I switched off all the python/matlab stuff=\r\n and it seems \n&gt; to build quite correctly all the directory lib, but when i=\r\nt goes to \n&gt; build the binary cti2ctml, it gives an ld segmentation fault. =\r\n\n&gt; (exactly the following error: &quot;collect2: ld terminated with signal \n&gt; 11=\r\n [Segmentation fault] /usr/bin/ld: bfd assertion fail \n&gt; elf64-alpha.c:3006=\r\n&quot;). \n&gt;  \n&gt; But the worst thing is that, more generally, I don&#39;t succeed in =\r\n\n&gt; creating any shared libraries with the even compiled libraries for \n&gt; th=\r\ne same error of the dynamic linker. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Do you have any idea to fix this=\r\n problem? \n&gt; Thank you all.
