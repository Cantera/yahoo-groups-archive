Thus, when the gas1 object is changed, and then gas2 is\ncalled, gas2 seeks out the address where gas1 is stored, where of\ncourse it finds the new, updated gas1.\n\nInstead, I&#39;d recommend initializing each object separately:\ngas1 = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;);\ngas2 = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;);\n\nHope this helps,\nSteven\n\n\n\n\n--- Josh Freeh &lt;jef15@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi everyone -\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to track two gases (of type Solution) in a Matlab file.\n&gt; When I modify one of the gases, the other changes as well. I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure if it&#39;s something with Matlab&#39;s variable handling or\n&gt; something with the Cantera code itself. I plan on trying to\n&gt; duplicate this in either Python or C++  to investigate whether it\n&gt; is something in Cantera. In the meantime, here&#39;s a short Matlab\n&gt; script that demonstrates this issue:\n&gt; \n&gt; clear all;\n&gt; gas1 = IdealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;);\n&gt; gas2 = gas1;\n&gt; gas1\n&gt; set(gas2,&#39;T&#39;,500);\n&gt; gas1\n&gt; gas2\n&gt; \n&gt; gas1 should still be at 300K but it is showing up at 500K like\n&gt; gas2.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance -\n&gt; \n&gt; Josh Freeh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
