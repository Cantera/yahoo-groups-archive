So, I uninstalled the 2.3 \nversion, removed it from my PATH, and viola---Cantera started \ncomplaining:  &quot;...could not convert input file to CTML&quot;.\n\nI uninstalled Cantera, Python, Numpy, etc., reboot, re-installed \nPython, Numpy stuff, and Cantera, and I still get the same thing.\n\nI am using Cantera 1.5.5 and Python 2.4, etc. (the standard stuff) \non a XP workstation.  \n\nSo, am I screwed or what?  I have tried to clean my system several \ntimes, and I keep getting the same behavior.  I have verified the \nfile pops up in the correct TMP directory.  I have also tried \nreplaciing the PYTHON_CMD and put c:&#92;Python24 in the PATH.  I have \nleft the directories to be the default values, and I have tried some \nnon-defaults.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n-----Mark\n\nAn example Python Traceback follows:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;mas&#92;Desktop&#92;Desktop&#92;Cantera2\n&#92;cantera15&#92;demos&#92;Python&#92;mix1.py&quot;, line 25, in ?\n    gas_a = Air()\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;Lib&#92;site-packages&#92;Cantera&#92;gases.py&quot;, line 40, in \nAir\n    return Solution(src=&quot;air.cti&quot;, id=&quot;air&quot;)\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;Lib&#92;site-packages&#92;Cantera&#92;solution.py&quot;, line 38, \nin __init__\n    root = XML.XML_Node(name = &#39;doc&#39;, src = src, preprocess = 1)\n  File &quot;C:&#92;Python24&#92;Lib&#92;site-packages&#92;Cantera&#92;XML.py&quot;, line 35, in \n__init__\n    self._xml_id = _cantera.xml_get_XML_File(src)\nerror: \n\n************************************************\n                Cantera Error!                  \n************************************************\n\n\nProcedure: ct2ctml\nError:   could not convert input file to CTML\n command line was: c:&#92;python24&#92;python.exe C:&#92;DOCUME~1&#92;mas&#92;LOCALS~1\n&#92;Temp/.cttmp1115691081.pyw&gt; ct2ctml.log 2&gt;&1\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
