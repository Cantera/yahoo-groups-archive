I do have a question \nc=\r\noncerning MixMaster. I plot the reaction paths for the ozone \nmechanism and=\r\n let me show the details. The question I have is, what \nis the meaning of S=\r\ncale and what do the numbers between two bubbles \nbefore the species symbol=\r\n mean? (e.g. O &#61664; O2, along the arrow is \nwritten: 0.0114 +O and the =\r\nscale is 1.2e+004)?\nThanks for helping.\nClaudia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
