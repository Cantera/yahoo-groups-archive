Error using =3D=3D&gt; ThermoPhase.equilibrate\nToo many inp=\r\nut arguments.\n\nWhen I view the code for equilibrate it seems that more than=\r\n two \ninput arguments is not allowed:\n\nfunction a =3D equilibrate(a, xy)\n% =\r\nEQUILIBRATE  Set the phase to a state of chemical equilibrium.\n%\n%   The se=\r\ncond argument must be one of the strings &#39;TP&#39;, &#39;TV&#39;,\n%   &#39;HP&#39;, &#39;SP&#39;, &#39;SV&#39;, =\r\n&#39;UV&#39;, &#39;PT&#39;, &#39;VT&#39;, &#39;PH&#39;, &#39;PS&#39;, &#39;VS&#39;, or &#39;VU&#39;,\n%   and specifies the two ther=\r\nmodynamic properties held fixed at\n%   the values in the initial state.

I would =\r\nvery much like to try your new \nsolver as speed is not a problem for me at =\r\nthis point.\n\n- Carl\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwi=\r\nn@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  From what you describe, it is hard to know where the prob=\r\nlem is.  \nMaybe \n&gt; the equilibrium solver is having trouble converging.  Yo=\r\nu can tell \nit \n&gt; to use the new solver by giving a third non-zero paramete=\r\nr to \n&gt; equilibrate, e.g.:\n&gt; \n&gt; equilibrate(gas, &#39;TP&#39;, 1)\n&gt; \n&gt; If the third=\r\n paramter is missing or zero, the old solver will be \nused, \n&gt; which is fas=\r\nter but less stable than the new one.  Equilibrium \nproblem \n&gt; usually aris=\r\ne from specifying very hard initial conditions, like an \n&gt; exactly stoichio=\r\nmetric fuel/air mixture at 300 K. Nevertheless, the \nnew \n&gt; solver should h=\r\nandle these cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other than that, you will need to do some debugging=\r\n to isolate the \n&gt; problem.  Since the transport demo works, you can start =\r\nwith it and \n&gt; modify it one line at a time until it looks like your m-file=\r\n that \n&gt; fails. In that way, you should be able to track down exactly what =\r\n\n&gt; change causes failure.  If it is not due to an initial condition \nand \n&gt;=\r\n seems to be something in Cantera, then see how small an m-file you \ncan \n&gt;=\r\n create that still fails by removing extraneous lines.  For example, \n&gt; doe=\r\ns it fail if you only do equillibrium? Or do you need to compute \n&gt; transpo=\r\nrt propertiess for it to fail?\n&gt; \n&gt; Once you have isolated the problem, sen=\r\nd the short m-file to me, \nand I \n&gt; can see if it fails for me too, and see=\r\n what the problem is.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 13, 2005, at 7:27 AM, xiao-yen w=\r\nang wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Prof. Goodwin:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Two weeks ago I posted the fo=\r\nllowing message:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi, there: Recently I tried to run Cantera 1.5.5 w=\r\nith Matlab on \nPC. I\n&gt; &gt; need compute the transport properties of a gas mix=\r\nture. I run the \nfile\n&gt; &gt; transport1.m in the MATLAB/demos and it works fin=\r\ne. But when I \nrun my\n&gt; &gt; own M file in which function equilibrate is used,=\r\n I got different \nkind\n&gt; &gt; of error messages. Sometimes, it runs and gives =\r\nme a reasonable \nresult,\n&gt; &gt; sometimes, it runs and gives Nan for all trans=\r\nport properties, \n&gt; &gt; sometimes\n&gt; &gt; it does not run and gives error message=\r\n such as &#39;segmentation \nerror&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; Note that the code itself is the same. =\r\nI just try run different \ntimes.\n&gt; &gt; It gives me different things. I guess =\r\nit is related to memory. \nAny help\n&gt; &gt; to fix this will be highly appreciat=\r\ned. Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have not received any reply. My colleague had the=\r\n similar \nproblem. \n&gt; &gt; We are in the process to incoporate Cantera into ou=\r\nr system \nmodleing \n&gt; &gt; using Matlab. One of my colleague does NOT has prob=\r\nlem because he \nhas \n&gt; &gt; the older version of Cantera. We need a solution t=\r\no fix the \nproblem. \n&gt; &gt; Could you please look into this? Should we downloa=\r\nd the older \nversion \n&gt; &gt; of Cantera? And which version should we use?\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Thanks again!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; xiaoyen wang\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  Yahoo!
