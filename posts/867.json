To the best of my knowledge, everything \nworks, including all MATLAB and Python demos.\n\nNew features:\n\n-  adiabatic, freely-propagating flames in Python.  See Python demo \n&#39;adiabatic_flame.py&#39;.  (Coming very soon to MATLAB, but not in this \nversion.)\n- class Mixture in Python and MATLAB for multiphase mixtures, and \nmultiphase equilibrium. See the Python demos for examples with \ncondensed phases.\n- improved support for electrochemistry and fuel cell modeling (but \nstill a work in progress).\n\n\nFixes / improvements:\n\n- nasa.cti data file split into 2: nasa_gas.cti and nasa_condensed.cti.\n- The ChemEquil equilibrium solver is now (again) more robust.  The \nproblems some people encountered in version 1..5.5 should now be fixed.\n- Some flame simulations should be faster now, due to removal of an \nunnecesary call to compute the viscosity.\n\nTo install it:\n  - completely remove Cantera 1.5.5 or earlier from your system, \nincluding removing the Cantera folder from \nC:&#92;python24&#92;Lib&#92;site-packages.\n  - run Cantera160.msi\n  - after it runs, run the Cantera Python installer in the Cantera \ninstallation folder.\n  - If you alreadyy set environment variables, etc., appropriately for \n1.5..5, that should be all you need to do. Otherwise, follow the same \nsteps as in the 1.5.5 installation documentation.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any problems!\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
