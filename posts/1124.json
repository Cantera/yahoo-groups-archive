But what I want to know is if there\n&gt; is some documentation for the Domain1D-methods.\n&gt; Now i only have the Cantera Windows .msi installed. Maybe there is\n&gt; some more information if I get the sources and work in C++?\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, I like Cantera very much what I know so far. Thanks to\n&gt; everybody who helped to develop.
