The successful\napplicant will participate in two funded, multidisciplinary team\nresearch programs - one focused on developing a micropower generator,\nand the other on fundamental studies of direct electrochemical\noxidation of hydrocarbons. A major component of the work will be\ndeveloping multiphysics numerical models of fuel cell components and\nsystems, ranging from models for elementary surface chemistry and\ntransport phenomena, to dynamic system models. Experience with fuel\ncells or related fields is desirable, as is proficiency in\nobject-oriented software design.\n\nFor more information or to apply, contact Professor David G.
