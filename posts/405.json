From the form of the error statement, I&#39;m guessing you are \nusing Visual C++.  If so, you need to set some project parameters when \nyou create a new project.  The easiest thing to do is add your project \nto the same workspace as the rest of Cantera, and specify that it \ndepends on all of the other projects.  Also, you will need to change \nsome of the default settings for Fortran and C++ to match the settings \nfor the other Cantera projects.\n\nThe basic problem here is that I no longer use a Windows PC for Cantera \ndevelopment, so the Windows compile/build procedure tends to get out of \ndate until someone points out a problem and I fire up the old Windows \nlaptop to see what is wrong... This is at best a short-term solution, \nbecause I don&#39;t even have the latest Microsoft compilers (.NET) or \nIntel Fortran, which I understand is the one to use together with \nVisual Studio .NET.  Since I&#39;m not planning to go back to Windows \n(except to build Windows versions of Cantera), some knowledgeable \nWindows/C++ user needs to step up and become the maintainer of \nWindows-specific aspects of Cantera, or else it may become more and \nmore difficult to keep the Windows version up to date.\n\nAnother alternative for users is to switch to Mac OS X or to linux (or \nsome other unix).  I can attest that Mac Powerbooks running OS X are \nreally very nice, and run all of the usual unix/gnu tools, including X \nWindows.  Of course, you also get freedom from most viruses, worms, \netc.  Cantera builds without problem on OS X, just like it does on \nlinux.  The only drawback I have found is that the mouse only has one \nbutton, not two (or three) but you get used to that.  Interoperability \nwith Windows is very good - you can share network drives, email Office \ndocuments to/from PCs, etc. For what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s what Bill Joy, \na founder of Sun Microsystems and the developer of Java, has to say \nabout Mac OS X:\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/billjoy.html\n\nJust a thought.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jun 1, 2004, at 12:07 PM, combustion2008 wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Dr. Goodwin or others:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a beginner for C++/cantera.
