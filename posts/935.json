Here is the\nerror message in ct2ctml.log file:\n\n         Traceback (most recent call last):\n              File &quot;./.cttmp1122240865.pyw&quot;, line 1, in ?\n              from ctml_writer import *\n         ImportError: No module named ctml_writer\n\nI had followed Dr. Goodwin&#39;s suggestion bellow. But couldn&#39;t figure\nout the destination folder to copy ctml_writer.py. My operation system\nis Redhat linux (Fedora). I installed cantera in &quot;/home/zhiwei/Cantera&quot;. \n\nPlease advise me how to solve this problme.\n\nMany thanks!\n\nZhiwei\n\n\nThe &#39;check&#39; script is run whenever the &#39;cttmp&#39; script fails, to see if\nthe problem is with the Cantera installation. Unfortunately the\nsingle-line &#39;check&#39; script will always fail, since it tries to import\nmodule &#39;ctml_writer&#39; from the Cantera package (where it used to be),\ninstead of importing it directly. The workaround is to copy file\n&#39;ctml_writer.py&#39; from the &#39;site_packages&#39; folder in the Python Library\nfolder to the &#39;Cantera&#39; folder within &#39;site_packages&#39;. it seems to me\nnow that running the &#39;check&#39; script is more trouble than it is worth,\nand I am removing this step from the procedure followed to translate\ninput files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
