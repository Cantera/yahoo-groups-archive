To build it, you need \nboth Visual C++ 6.0 and Visual Fortran 6.0. A Fortran-only version \nthat doesn&#39;t require C++ will be posted later this morning.\n\nIt can be downloaded from http://blue.caltech.edu/cantera-1.2-r1.zip.\nUnzip the file, and read file License.txt for information on the \nlicense terms. You implicitly agree to these terms if you use Cantera.\n\nThen go to the win32 directory. Open workspace file cantera.dsw, and \nbuild everything.\n\nSet environment variable CANTERA_ROOT to the top cantera directory \n(cantera-1.2). Under WinNT Or Win2000, do this by right-clicking \non &quot;My Computer&quot; and selecting &quot;Properties.&quot;\n\n\nProjects &#39;zero&#39; and &#39;testit&#39; build executables that should run \nwithout modification. &#39;zero&#39; is a zero-dimensional kinetics \nsimulator, and &#39;testit&#39; can run any of the examples in the manual.\n\n\nTo build your own Fortran Cantera application:\n1) make a new project\n2) add your files\n3) specify that it depends on projects &#39;ctf&#39; and &#39;fortran90&#39;\n4) open the &#39;settings&#39; panel, and under &#39;Fortran&#39; specify the \nmultithreaded DLL library, and that module files are in \ndirectory &#39;lib&#39;.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any problems, sugestions, etc.\n\n\nbtw - &#39;cstr_t&#39; in the manual has been replaced by &#39;reactor_t&#39;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
