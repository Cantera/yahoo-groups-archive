I am planning to =\r\nwrite program in C++ which, among \nothers, will be calculating gas composit=\r\nion in equlibrium state. All \nI need is a function which input data are tem=\r\nperature and gas \ncomposition, and output data is composition in equlibrium=\r\n state. I \nfound here \nhttp://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_i=\r\nd=3D78833 in \nCantera workshop section in introduction.pdf file that it is =\r\npossible \n(or at least I think so, but I might be wrong). At page 23 of thi=\r\ns \npdf file is a code that looks like it is a way to solve my problem:\n\n#in=\r\nclude &quot;Cantera.h&quot;\n#include &quot;GRI30.h&quot;\n#include &quot;equilibrium.h&quot;\n\n//using name=\r\nspace std;\nint main()\n{\n\tGRI30 gas;\n\tgas.setState_TPX(300.0, OneAtm, &quot;CH4:1=\r\n,O2:2,N2:7.52&quot;);\n\tequilibrate(gas, &quot;HP&quot;);\n\tcout &lt;&lt; gas;\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n\nHow =\r\nto do it to have such function in C++? I followed the \ninstructions that ar=\r\ne in pdf files in section Building and installing \n(cantera153-build-win32.=\r\npdf and cantera154-build.pdf) but I met some \ndifficulties. If anyone could=\r\n help me, I&#39;d be very grateful. If \nsomeone someone takes on to do it, I wi=\r\nll write precisely where I \nfound difficulties.\n\nI have Visual C++ 6.0 Intr=\r\noductionary Edition (I also have ver 5.0 \nProfessional Edition but trying t=\r\no use it, difficulties appeared \nearlier, I couldn&#39;t do &#39;build all&#39;), I don=\r\n&#39;t have MATLAB (and I&#39;m not \ngoing to have) and I&#39;m interesting in writting=\r\n program in Vicual C++ \n(not in Python) and my computer knowledge is quite =\r\npoor (I just can \nwritte programs in C++ or Fortran).\n\nRegards,\nRafa=B3\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
