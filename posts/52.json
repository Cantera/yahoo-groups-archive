It has been \nverified to compile &#39;out of the box&#39; under Windows (Visual C++ 6) and \nlinux (g++). It should also compile on any other system with gnu \ncompilers, as well as on any SGI system. Solaris and HP-UX may still \nrequire some porting work. If you port to a new OS, please let me \nknow what, if anything, you had to modify. Also, I would encourage \nanyone who is a Mac expert to try porting to the Mac... \n\nThe same source distribution is available in tar and zip formats:\n\nhttp://blue.caltech.edu/cantera/cantera-1.2-src-042402.tar.gz\n\nhttp://blue.caltech.edu/cantera/cantera-1.2-src-042402.zip\n\n\n\n\n"}}
