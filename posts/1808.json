Since I no longer use a Windows  \nPC, I don&#39;t have easy access to Visual Studio, and therefore its  \nproject files tend to lag behind the unix/mac Makefiles. I know there  \nare some cross-platform build tools that can generate both unix/Mac  \nMakefiles and Windows Visual Studio project files. One is CMake.   \nI&#39;ve played with it a little, and it seems promising. Anyone have  \nexperience with CMake?\n\nOther than that, we&#39;ll need someone to volunteer to be the &quot;Cantera  \nWindos Guru&quot;, who will keep the Visual Studio files current, and  \nhandle Windows-related problems users have. Any volunteers?\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jan 1, 2008, at 1:27 PM, yarmond wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve been working on building Cantera using MS Visual Studio 2005 from\n&gt; the most recent CVS source, and it appears that the vcproj files in\n&gt; CVS are out of date.
