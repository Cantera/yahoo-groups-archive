I mean,\n&gt; I can create one, and set its temperature and pressure, and get its\n&gt; temperature and pressure, and equilibrate it, and set the quantity of\n&gt; moles of each phase in it (either directly or by species) and get them\n&gt; back, and add phases to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, and I can get the chemical potentials of each species, which means\n&gt; I can actually get some thermodynamic data out.\n&gt;\n&gt; That, unfortunately, is a pretty limited list.  Thus, my questions:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Is it possible to get thermodynamic data (energy, entropy, etc.) for\n&gt; the entire mixture out of a Mixture object?  If so, how?\n&gt;\n&gt; * Is is possible to get thermodynamic data for a given phase out of a\n&gt; Mixture object?\n&gt;\n&gt; * Is it possible to get a list of species out of a Mixture object, so\n&gt; that I know which species the various chemical potentials (or\n&gt; whatever) correspond to?\n&gt;\n&gt; * Is it possible to retrieve a phase from a Mixture object, so that I\n&gt; could otherwise manipulate it to determine the relevant thermodynamic\n&gt; data?\n&gt;\n&gt; * What is the syntax for the speciesIndex function on a Mixture?  (It\n&gt; takes two arguments other than the mixture, but the comment in the\n&gt; file only mentions one, and it seems that I simply get the second\n&gt; argument returned to me if it&#39;s a number, or the ASCII value of the\n&gt; first letter if it&#39;s a string.)\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, it looks like the Mixture objects are exactly what one of\n&gt; my colleagues needs for the program he&#39;s currently working on, so I&#39;m\n&gt; hoping I&#39;m just missing something....\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; - Brooks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
