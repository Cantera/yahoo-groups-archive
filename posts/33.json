Eligible programs include \nanything of reasonably general interest, from flame or reactor \nnumerical models to pre- or post-processors, etc.\n\nBenefits:\n1) Your program may run substantially faster, particularly if it does \nkinetics calculations.\n2) Your application will be based on open-source libraries.\n3) You receive the recognition associated with providing useful \nsoftware tools to the user community.\n4) You will further the goal of open-source software tools for \nreacting flow simulation and analysis.\n\nGround rules:\n\n1) the code must be in the public domain, or you must hold copyright \nto the files you submit, or you must certify that contributing it \ndoes not violate any license terms of any third-party code your \napplication uses.\n\n2) The program cannot contain any source code that is part of Chemkin \n(any version - I,II, or III), or any other commercial software \nlibrary. It is fine if it contains calls to subroutines in such \nlibraries, since these calls will be replaced by calls to equivalent \nCantera procedures in the porting process.\n\n3) You agree that a tar or zip archive of your program can be posted \non a web site. It will not be part of the Cantera distribution, but \nwill be available for download from a page devoted to third-party \nCantera-based applications. (The idea is something like NetLib.)\n\n4) Your code will retain your copyright, you will decide what files \ngo in the posted archive, and it will be subject to the license terms \nyou specify (i.e., the GNU Public License or something else).\n\n\nIf you are possibly interested in doing this, please contact me off-\nline at dgoodwin@.... First come, first served.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
