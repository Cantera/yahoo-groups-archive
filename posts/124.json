Go \nto http://www.cantera.org then follow the &#39;download&#39; or &#39;SourceForge&#39; \nlinks.\n\nGet the python file and the .msi file and run them both. If you are \nasked whether to repair or remove Cantera when running the .msi file, \nselect &#39;remove&#39; and then re-run it. With the Python file, specify that \nfiles should be overwritten.\n\nWindows users will not notice too many differences from 1.3.5. A few \nnew methods have been added to flame.py, stagnation flows may now have \na non-zero radial velocity at the inlet, negative pre-exponentials are \nnow allowed in rate coefficients (for use with duplicate reactions) + a \nfew minor bug fixes and somewhat better documentation.\n\nAlso, the web site has been updated, and the documentation of the C++ \nsource code has been updated, Python documentation has also been added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
