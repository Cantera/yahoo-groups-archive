I found the necessary thermo data to create the \ninput .cti files from the NASA Glenn website and i verified that the \nprogram was reading the thermo data propertly by matching the thermo \nproperties to tabulated thermo data.  The code runs fine from 300-\n10000 K then I get an error message for any temperature greater than \n10,000 K.\n\n??? Error using ==&gt; thermophase/equilibrate\n\nProcedure: equilibrate\nError:   no convergence in 1000iterations.\n\nError in ==&gt; C:&#92;MATLAB6p5&#92;work&#92;PlasmaEquilWAr.m\nOn line 36  ==&gt;  equilibrate(HiTempAir,&#39;TP&#39;)\n\nThe temperature ranges that i use are 300-1000 K, 1000-6000 K, and \n6000-20,000 K, so the problem is not a transition from one \ntemperature range to another.  Some of the thermo properities for \nhigh temperature air have a peak near 10,000 K and this may be \ncausing a problem with the minimazation of the Gibbs free energy to \nfind the equilibrium composition.  Or it could be that more \niterations need to be taken to acieve conergence.  I cannot find a \ncommand in MATLAB to alter the convergence critera and I&#39;m not sure \nof how to do this with the C++ source code.  Another problem i&#39;m \nhaving is find all the C++ source code for Cantera and linking to \nthe header files.  Any help would be greatly apprecieated.\n\nThank You,\nSean Henderson\n\n\n"}}
