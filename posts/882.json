The actual mdot\n&gt; is part\n&gt;&gt; of the solution.  Once the initial temperature guess has been\n&gt; specified, the\n&gt;&gt; user needs to choose a temperature at a location to hold constant.\n&gt; This is\n&gt;&gt; done by:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \tflame.setFixedTemperature(900.0);\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then the user needs to specify that this flame is adiabatic\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \tflame.setAdiabaticFlame();\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Once this is done then the solution can be obtained by running:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \tflame.solve(loglevel=1,refine_grid);\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Karl\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt; From: cantera@yahoogroups.com [mailto:cantera@yahoogroups.com]On\n&gt; Behalf\n&gt;&gt; Of cantera_user\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 22, 2005 11:25 AM\n&gt;&gt; To: cantera@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [cantera] question about freely propagating flame in phyton\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello guys,\n&gt;&gt; can anyone give a brief description on how the new freely\n&gt; propagating\n&gt;&gt; flame tools works, please?
