Note that space is limited, so please register early \n&gt; if you want to attend.\n&gt; \n&gt; The morning will be a tutorial, focusing on using Cantera from Matlab \n&gt; and/or Python, but could also cover C++ if there is sufficient \n&gt; interest.  CDs will be available with the latest versions of Cantera \n&gt; and supporting software for Windows,, Mac OS X,  and linux, plus all \n&gt; workshop materials.  If you bring your laptop (optional), you can \n&gt; install/upgrade Cantera on the spot and work along with the tutorial.\n&gt; \n&gt; in the afternoon, there will be an opportunity for some of you to \n&gt; describe how you are using Cantera.  If you are using Cantera in \n&gt; teaching, or in research, or in other ways, please consider giving a \n&gt; short (~15 minute) presentation about your application.  On your \n&gt; registration form, note at the bottom any topic you would be interested \n&gt; in presenting, and I&#39;ll contact you about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; We will finish by 3 pm at the latest.  Hope to see you there.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n\n\n"}}
