To do this, I \nam making the reservoir have the same temperature as the initial \ntemperature of the gas in the reactor, and then including a very large \nheat transfer coefficient for the wall between the reservoir and the \nreactor.  The problem is that when I include the heat transfer \ncoefficient, the initial temperature of the gas in the reactor jumps \nto about 400 K higher than the temperature I specify.  What could be \nthe cause of this?\nThank you anyone who can help, and thanks again to Dr. Goodwin for the \ntutorial at the School of Mines.\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n\n"}}
