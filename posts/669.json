In general, \nany manual modification of the state of a reactor should be avoided.\n\nHere&#39;s a better approach:  define a reaction mechanism of reversible \nreactions that connect all of the species.  These do not need to be \nelementary reactions.  For example, you could  write formation \nreactions for each species from a set of &#39;constituents&#39; (perhaps major \nspecies, or even the atomic vapor species - e.g. C + 4H &lt;=&gt; CH4).  Give \neach reaction a sufficiently large rate coefficient so that it is fast \ncompared to the time scales of interest.  Then simply use this \nmechanism in your reactor. You should find that the results are \nindependent of the rate constants chosen, as long as they are all fast \nenough.  You can check that the rates are fast enough by looking at the \ncharacteristic destruction times (concentration / molar destruction \nrate).\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jan 17, 2005, at 5:15 AM, albrechtheinzel wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Cantera-users,\n&gt; I&#39;m writing to get some help with the cantera reactor objects. I do\n&gt; some transient reactor network simulation. One of the reactors in the\n&gt; network is supposed to be a gibbs minimizer. Therefore I take after\n&gt; every &quot;advance&quot;-command the gasobject out of the reactor and\n&gt; performed an equilibrate(gas,&#39;UV&#39;) and returned it back in the\n&gt; reactor. I would prefer a simultaneously solution of the gibbs\n&gt; minimizing in this reactor. That way I do the calculations the size\n&gt; of the time steps (`advance&#39;) is limited to very small value to avoid\n&gt; convergence problems. If anybody has some suggestions to overcome\n&gt; these limitations I will appreciate it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;    Albrecht\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
