You can also \ncreate your own binary installer programs (.msi files) and distribute \nthem to install Cantera (+ your own application code) on machines that \ndo not have Visual Studio.\n\nNow there is no need to have cygwin (but personally I would install it \nanyway), or to do anything from a command line, or to have Fortran.  I \nthink virtually all Windows installation problems should be gone now.  \n(Also, the Python location is no longer hard-wired to C:&#92;PYTHON23.)\n\nThe procedure is described step-by-step in a Powerpoint presentation I \nhave also posted at the Sourceforge site under &quot;Cantera Documentation&quot; \n- see file cantera-vc7.ppt.\n\nOther than that, you may notice a new class &quot;Mixture&quot; in Python, and a \ncouple of new classes (MultiPhase and MultiPhaseEquil) in C++. These \nimplement multi-phase mixtures and a new multi-phase equilibrium \nsolver.  It is fully functional in Python and C++ now (MATLAB soon), \nbut is not documented, so its official introduction will be in Cantera \n1.6 which will be out in January.  Cantera 1.6 will contain also some \nnew phase models, and some improved support for non-ideal phases.\n\nWindows people in particular - if you have Visual C++ .NET, please try \nout the new build procedure, and report any problems.\n\n\n\n"}}
