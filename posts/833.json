I am using the equilibrium Matlab demo to determine the \ntemperature of a mixture of N2O and C2H6 after the mixture has \nreacted to equilibrium.  In addition to getting the &quot;no convergence \nafter 1000 iterations&quot; message, it returns the following warning:\n\nWarning:Temperature (3006.05 K) outside valid range of 300 K to 3000 K\nWarning:Temperature (3036.15 K) outside valid range of 300 K to 3000 K\n\nI am still learning to use Cantera, so I am just using the data in \ngri30.cti.  The data for C2H6 uses the temperature ranges 200-1000K \nand 1000-3500K, and the data for N2O uses the ranges 200-1000K and \n1000-6000K.  Why does it say that the valid temperature range is only \nfrom 300-3000K?  Is this also why there is no solution after 1000 \niterations?  Is there some way to change what the valid temperature \nrange is, as well as a way to increase the number of iterations?  \nThank you very much, and I look forward to attending your seminar \nhere at Mines later this month.\n\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n"}}
