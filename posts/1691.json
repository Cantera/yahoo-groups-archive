I&#39;m usi=\r\nng IdealGasMix \nwith an H2/O2/N2O mechanism.  I have calculated the sensiti=\r\nvities for \n1% H2, 0.5% O2 and 98.5% N2.  When I compare my results with re=\r\nsults \nfrom previous work for the same conditions, I find reaction \nsensiti=\r\nvities to significantly different reactions.  I&#39;ve checked the \npre-exponen=\r\ntial terms and they are slightly different but the \nreactions should show t=\r\nhe same trend relative to one another and they \ndon&#39;t.  For example, my res=\r\nults show the most significant reactions \nare recombination/dissociation re=\r\nactions, while the previous results \nshow chain reactions as the most signi=\r\nficant, which makes sense.  So, \nI&#39;m wondering, is there any other document=\r\nation that describes the \noutput from the sensitivity1.py script?\n\nI&#39;ve als=\r\no tried using GRI30() but the results don&#39;t match when I \nconsider the pre-=\r\nexpontential terms from each mechanism.   Is there \nanything hardcoded into=\r\n GRI30() that isn&#39;t captured in IdealGasMix \nthat might change the sensitiv=\r\nities?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\nRusty \n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; They are normalized.\n&gt; \n&gt; On =\r\nJan 29, 2007, at 11:42 AM, jasonploeger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello, I am using the=\r\n sim.sensitivity function to get sensitivity\n&gt; &gt; coefficients for a fairly =\r\nsimple combustion-type chemistry \nsystem.
