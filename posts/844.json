(At least, \nyou can do this if you are working in C++.) This type of outlet \nsimulates a boundary condition imposed by a fast crossflow across a \nflow straightener at the outlet. Both the temperature and mass \nfractions are held to values that you can set.\n\nIn the released version of Cantera, however, this object type is not \naccessible from MATLAB or Python.  But I have just now added the \nnecessary hooks for MATLAB, and have run an example unstrained \ndiffusion flame in MATLAB to verify that it works.  These capabilities \nwill be present in the new release that I am trying to get out in the \nnext few days.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Jun 8, 2005, at 11:42 AM, steven_r_biles wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in modeling a 1 dimensional unstrained diffusion\n&gt; flame.  The code I would like to set up is very similar to the Flame1\n&gt; demo.  I would like to replace the &#39;outlet&#39;, which appears to only\n&gt; specify gradients, with something like the reservior, which specifies\n&gt; a fixed temperature and composition.  Cantera complains that reservoir\n&gt; is not a Domain1D object.  What object can I use instead?\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
