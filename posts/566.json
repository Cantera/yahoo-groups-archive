However, you can certainly incorporate \nCantera&#39;s chemistry engine into an external code representing your \nsystem. Depending on what you&#39;re trying to represent, you&#39;ll need \nvarious mixing, fluid mechanics, flame velocity, and heat transfer \nmodels. Such things are often quite system dependant. Perhaps if you \ntold us what kind of closed-volume combustion system you&#39;re looking \nat we might be able to give you a nudge in the right direction.\n\nChad\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kochzg&quot; &lt;kochzg@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi \n&gt; But I would like to calculate combustion process in 2D.\n&gt; Is it possible??????.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Kochzg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
