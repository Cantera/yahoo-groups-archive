There&#39;s a new test\n&gt; prob=\r\nlem, CpJump, that demonstrates that the new  algorithm can handle\n&gt; jumps i=\r\nn Cp and H at temperature boundaries. The old algorithm could not\n&gt; handle =\r\nthese jumps.

Error: no convergen=\r\nce. dt =3D\n&gt; 0.000219057\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;    Since the entropy and enthalpy are mo=\r\nnotonic functions of T, I could\n&gt; probably change the solution algorithm to=\r\n a root finder algorithm rather\n&gt; than the Newton&#39;s method that is currentl=\r\ny being employed. Newton&#39;s\n&gt; method rigorously requires that the first deri=\r\nvative be continuous for\n&gt; convergence to be achieved. This in turn require=\r\ns that Cp and H and/or S\n&gt; be continuous at temperature boundaries. This is=\r\n normally the case, and\n&gt; a warning message is printed out if it isn&#39;t the =\r\ncase. However, the\n&gt; question then becomes to what degree are these functio=\r\nns continuous\n&gt; across temperature boundaries and can one then make a state=\r\nment about\n&gt; how &quot;continuous&quot; they have to be in order for the setState_HP =\r\nand\n&gt; setState_SP functions to converge for all cases.\n&gt;    A root finder a=\r\nlgorithm has less requirements on the smoothness of\n&gt; the function than a N=\r\newton&#39;s method algorithm. So, it should be more\n&gt; robust.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Also, I co=\r\nuld expose the convergence requirements for these two\n&gt; functions in the ma=\r\ntlab levels. Currently, they are exposed at the C++\n&gt; level with defaults o=\r\nn dT of 1.0E-4.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; Harry Moffat\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Harry Moffat       =\r\n                                      (w) (505)\n&gt; 844-6912\n&gt; Multiphase & N=\r\nanoscale Transport Division    (f)   (505) 844-8251\n&gt; Sandia National Labor=\r\natories\n&gt; hkmoffa@...\n&gt; P.

I am using\n=\r\n&gt; Cantera  from within Matlab, where I solve systems of compressors and\n&gt; t=\r\nurbines.  It works great most of the time!  However when my code asks\n&gt; Can=\r\ntera to setState_SP (entropy and Pressure) or set_State_HP and this\n&gt; state=\r\n fall sufficiently close to 1000K, Cantera crashes.  I know I could\n&gt; fudge=\r\n my quarry in the hopes I don&#39;t land on a 1000K condition but I\n&gt; would rat=\r\nher know my code (and Cantera) are rock stable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe this is happe=\r\nning because of the NASA polynomials switching\n&gt; coefficients at 1000K, and=\r\n while the polynomials are close to each\n&gt; other, the setState function req=\r\nuires 10^-8 accuracy (way more than I\n&gt; require).\n&gt;\n&gt; I am hoping someone e=\r\nlse has solved this problem or can offer\n&gt; assistance.\n&gt; My current thought=\r\n is to find the function(s) where the polynomial\n&gt; coefficients are chosen =\r\nfor the appropriate temperature range.   Then\n&gt; add\n&gt; a case such that betw=\r\neen T =3D 999 and 1001 a new polynomial will be\n&gt; interpolated and used for=\r\n the subsequent thermo calculations.\n&gt; Unfortunately I have yet to find whi=\r\nch functions these are and deduce if\n&gt; this may really work/help?\n&gt;\n&gt; Your =\r\nhelp will be greatly appreciated,\n&gt; Winston Burbank\n&gt; ftwsb@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Y=\r\nahoo!
