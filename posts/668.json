I do \nsome transient reactor network simulation. One of the reactors in the \nnetwork is supposed to be a gibbs minimizer. Therefore I take after \nevery &quot;advance&quot;-command the gasobject out of the reactor and \nperformed an equilibrate(gas,&#39;UV&#39;) and returned it back in the \nreactor. I would prefer a simultaneously solution of the gibbs \nminimizing in this reactor. That way I do the calculations the size \nof the time steps (`advance&#39;) is limited to very small value to avoid \nconvergence problems. If anybody has some suggestions to overcome \nthese limitations I will appreciate it.\n\nThanks\n   Albrecht \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
