If you \nw=\r\nant to run your simulation in Python, all you need to do is this:\n\n1) Creat=\r\ne 2 reactors that share a common wall (A), and make it flexible \nenough to =\r\nmaintain pressure equilibrium.\n2) Add a second wall (B) to reactor 2 with a=\r\n specified vdot rate vs. \ntime.  This will actually change the total volume=\r\n, not just volume 2, \nwith time, since the rate of volume change for each r=\r\neactor is computed \nby summing over all of its walls. Thus, the rate of cha=\r\nnge of volume of \nreactor 1 plus reactor 2 equals the specified vdot for wa=\r\nll B:  dV/dt_1 \n+ dV/dt_2 =3D vdot(A) + (vdot(B) - vdot(A)) =3D vdot(B).\n\nT=\r\nhe only reason this can&#39;t be done from Matlab too is that I haven&#39;t \ngotten=\r\n around to adding the necessary interfacing code to the Matlab \ntoolbox. It=\r\n&#39;s not hard to do, and I&#39;ll add it to the list of requested \nenhancements.\n=\r\n\nDave Goodwin\n\n\n\nOn Feb 18, 2004, at 7:37 AM, thomassteinhilber wrote:\n\n&gt; D=\r\near Mr. Goodwin,\n&gt;\n&gt; I=B4m a PhD student at the Technical University of Mun=\r\nich and using\n&gt; Cantera for the simulation of gas compression up to auto-ig=\r\nnition.\n&gt; With little changes to your matlab demo &quot;ignite2&quot; I managed the\n&gt;=\r\n compression of one gas-volume (wich was actually quite easy, thanks\n&gt; for =\r\nthe good demo versions!).\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I would like to compress two, coupled rea=\r\nctors, with pressure\n&gt; equilibrium.
