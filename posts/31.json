This initial libraries released \nwill be for Visual Fortran under Windows. The unix/linux version will \nprobably come out some time next week, time permitting.\n\nYou can get a preview of what&#39;s coming by looking at the latest \ndraft of the in-progress Cantera Fortran manual (117 pages so far). \nIt&#39;s at http://blue.caltech.edu/cantera12.pdf.\n\nCantera 1.2 is a major upgrade from 1.1b. The two big-ticket items \nare the multicomponent transport package, and the Fortran 90 \ninterface, but there are many other improvements and additions as \nwell. As always, I welcome your comments and suggestions for \nimprovements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
