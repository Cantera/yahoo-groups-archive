I did encounter problems reading some \nmechanisms files, and comments in the newsgroup suggested that these \nmay now be fixed in the latest version. \n\nThus, I am now trying to build the matlab interface in windows using \nversion 1.3.  It appears to require ct.lib in the &quot;cantera-1.3&#92;lib&#92;&quot; \ndirectory (I get this from looking at buildwin.m).   I believe I need \nto build this library using the visual c++ compiler.  If this is \ncorrect, and since I do not have the visual c++ compiler, would it be \npossible to provide the ct.lib file? Are there any other libraries \nrequired to build the matlab interface?\n\nThanks,\n\nDan Flowers\nLLNL\n\n\n\n"}}
