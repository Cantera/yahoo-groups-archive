I think the Intel Fortran compiler is.  Since I \nhardly ever use a PC anymore, perhaps someone else can better answer \nthis question.\n\nThe f77 and f90 demo programs can all be built very easily on systems \nthat support the GNU tools (make, autoconf, etc.) and compilers (g++, \ng77).  In my opinion, anyone planning to do serious work in Fortran (or \nC++) with Cantera should at least consider getting a machine that runs \nsome unix-like operating system, such as linux or Mac OS X.  You can \nget one for less than $1K, and don&#39;t need to buy expensive commercial \ncompilers.  Just a thought...\n\nDave G.\n\n\nOn May 26, 2005, at 2:01 PM, killakella2000 wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello.. I am trying to link my Fortran program to Cantera.  I built\n&gt; and installed Cantera from the source code using Visual C++ .NET,\n&gt; then I found the f77demo project under the source code download\n&gt; directory:  cantera-1.5.5&#92;tools&#92;templates&#92;f77.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6.a installed, which is what I\n&gt; created my original Fortran program on.  I tried opening and\n&gt; building the f77demo project, but the header files (idealgasmix.h,\n&gt; etc) could not be located.  I fixed this by changing the paths to\n&gt; the header files in the demo_ftnlib.cpp file to\n&gt; C:&#92;Cantera&#92;include&#92;cantera&#92;***.h, which is where the Cantera\n&gt; installation apparently puts them.  This fixed that problem, but now\n&gt; I get a bunch of &quot;unresolved external symbol&quot; errors.\n&gt;\n&gt; The readme file included in the f77demo project folder states that I\n&gt; can just open the project file and build it because Compaq Visual\n&gt; Fortran 6.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 share a common development\n&gt; environment (Visual Studio).  Is this not the case with Visual\n&gt; C++ .NET?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is my understanding that I need to create the .obj file from the\n&gt; demo_ftnlib.cpp and run the included makefile to link that .obj file\n&gt; to the one created by the Fortran program.  If this is not what is\n&gt; supposed to happen, please let me know.  Obviously at this point, I\n&gt; am having trouble just creating the object file from the\n&gt; demo.ftnlib.cpp file.\n&gt;\n&gt; As you can probably tell, my programming experience is very\n&gt; limited.  If someone can point me in the right direction to get the\n&gt; demo program working it would be greatly appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
