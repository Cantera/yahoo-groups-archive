You should first check that all species  \nproduction rates are zero when the gas mole fractions are the  \nequilibrium values for the computed T and P. By definition, the  \nadiabatic flame temperature is the temperature achieved at  \nequilibrium, at fixed enthalpy and pressure, with equilibrium mole  \nfractions.  But of course chemistry may make the mole fractions  \nstrong functions of temperature, so the partitioning of energy among  \ndifferent forms will result in the sensible energy component  \n(proportional to temperature) changing strongly wih T.  In any case,  \nusing global irreversible kinetic rate laws never works near  \nequilibrium. If it works at all, it would be for situations far from  \nequilibrium, such as in the unburned gases.\n\nNo global reaction mechanism with non-integral stoichiometric  \ncoefficients is accurate outside the range of parameters for which it  \nwas fit.  If the mechanism was determined by fitting to ignition  \ndata, for example, then it may be useful to interpret other ignition  \nproblems too (or maybe not, hard to say), but it absolutely cannot be  \nused to simulate very different procsses. Th only way to achieve a  \nrobust simulation of a flame is to include all of the important  \nelemenary reactions, and model all reactions s raaeversible (which  \nevery elementary reaction in fact is\nThe only way to accurately compute flame speeds is to use reaction  \nmechanisms with multiple (perhaps hundreds) of elementary reactions,  \nthe rate of each of which obeys mass-action kinetics and is  \nreversible.  But this is easy with Cantera - it does all of the hard  \nwork for you.  See for example the Python demos under &quot;flames.&quot;\n\nHope this helps,\nDave\n\n\nOn Feb 15, 2008, at 2:44 AM, benedetta.franzelli wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi!!\n&gt; I have already solved this problem. For 1step-reaction CH4 + 2 O2 =&gt;\n&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O is sufficient to modifie the orders of the reaction in the\n&gt; .cti file. Now, i&#39;m trying to perform a 1D premixed flame with a 2step\n&gt; reaction:\n&gt; 1) CH4 +1.5 02 =&gt; CO +2 H2O, Arrhenius parameters=[0.6000E+16, 0.0,\n&gt; 35000], order=&quot;CH4:0.9 O2:1.10 &quot;\n&gt; 2) CO + 0.5 O2 &lt;=&gt; CO2, Arrhenius parametr=[0.2E+10, 0.0, 12000].\n&gt; In this case it is not sufficent to change the order of the reaction\n&gt; to achieve some good results. Actually, the method is convergent but,\n&gt; even if the adiabatic temperature and the mole fractions of the\n&gt; species are correct, the speed flame is completly wrong. I can&#39;t find\n&gt; where is the problem.
