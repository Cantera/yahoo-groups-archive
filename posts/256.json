I think \nthe\n&gt; Windows Visual C++ project files have become out of date.  It has\n&gt; unfortunately become a bit cumbersome to build Cantera under \nWindows.\n&gt; You need not only Visual C++ and Compaq Visual Fortran, but also a\n&gt; unix-like environment (e.g. cygwin) so that some unix shell \nscripts can\n&gt; be run by the build process.\n\nAh.  So this would be why I&#39;ve been having similar problems.  (I \nhadn&#39;t\nquite gotten things sorted so as to properly ask about it,\nthough.)  We&#39;ve also been having troubles with simply linking the\nCantera dll into another C application, but I&#39;m not yet sure that \nthis\nisn&#39;t errors on our part.\n\nIf this linking problem is known part of the problem you mention with\nthe latest versions of Cantera, what version would be the latest that\nstill has in-date project files for use in Windows?\n\n&gt; The problem is exacerbated by the fact\n&gt; that Microsoft no longer sells Visual C++ 6.0, but Compaq (now HP?)\n&gt; Visual Fortran has not been updated to support Visual Studio .NET.\n\nAnd this information, is itself now out of date.  Compaq Visual \nFortran\nbecame not HP, but Digital Visual Fortran.  This was bought by Intel,\nwith the intent of merging it with their compiler.  The 8.0 release \nof\nIntel&#39;s Fortran compiler -- which just came out two weeks ago -- is \nthe\nsuccessor to both Intel&#39;s 7.x compiler and to Visual Fortran.  And,\nfurther, it _is_ fully integrated with Visual Studio .NET.\n\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n"}}
