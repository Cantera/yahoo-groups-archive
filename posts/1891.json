The reason is a high inlet gas \n&gt; temperature. Approximately, the adiab=\r\natic flame temperature \nincreases \n&gt; as the preheating temperature divided =\r\nby two. You preheat more than \n&gt; 1000 K your unburned gas mixture, therefor=\r\ne, the flame temperature \n&gt; should be around 2000 + 1000/2 ~ 2500 K. More i=\r\nmportantly, I am \n&gt; afraid that the temperature of the unburned gases could=\r\n not \n&gt; correspond to the physical reality. It seems that this temperature =\r\n\nis \n&gt; above the mixture&#39;s autoignition temperature. In this case it means =\r\n\n&gt; that this mixture can exist only very short (a few milliseconds or \n&gt; le=\r\nss) time before autoignition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, Anatoli \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cante=\r\nra@yahoogroups.com, &quot;changye_liu&quot; &lt;changyeliu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear al=\r\nl, I am new in Cantera and I try to use the demo code \n&gt; &gt; flamespeed to ca=\r\nlculate the flame property.
