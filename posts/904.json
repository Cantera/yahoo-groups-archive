There aren&#39;t\nany apparent candidates in the toolbox, but I thought I&#39;d check.\n\nMuch thanks,\nSteven DeCaluwe\n\nps.  regarding my troubles with the &#39;display&#39; function last week, the\nissue still hasn&#39;t been solved.  I followed your instructions, Dr.\nGoodwin, it worked in python, and I&#39;m certain that it is accessing\nthe correct &#39;display&#39; function in the matlab toolbox, but it still\nproduces no output.  I&#39;m wondering if it could be some deleterious\neffect of using matlab 6.1, versus a more current edition?  The\nfunction isn&#39;t incredibly vital to my current modeling efforts, so\nI&#39;m not going to pursue it much further, but I thought I&#39;d give an update.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
