It \nallows you to fix T, or solve the energy equation, but it doesn&#39;t allow \nspecified T(time), or P(time).\n\nFor now, probably the best thing to do is to write the ODEs yourself, \nand use Cantera to evaluate the terms in the equations. See, for \nexample, the Cantera MATLAB demos &quot;ignite.m&quot;, &quot;ignite2.m&quot;, and the \nfunction in the Cantera toolbox &quot;reactor_ode.m&quot; for an example of this \napproach. The MATLAB stiff ODE integrator used in these demos works \nfine for these problems.\n\nI have actually written a new class &quot;FlowReactor&quot; that is closer to \nwhat you want, but it is not ready for release yet.   It is designed to \nsimulate reacting plug flow in a channel, and includes compressibility \neffects, heat loss, friction, etc.  I&#39;ll make sure to allow specified \nT(x) and P(x) as an option.  I don&#39;t know precisely when this will be \nready for release - maybe in a couple of weeks.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Nov 8, 2005, at 8:04 AM, peyelvington wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Group,\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to simulate a zero-d, variable-T,P reactor.
