I have started to poke\naround in the source code,=\r\n and it at first glance it looks as if\nsome/much/all of the solution phase =\r\ncode is missing. \n\nEventually I will want to worry about solubilities, phas=\r\ne separation,\netc. but for now an ideal solution will be a useful start.\n\nI=\r\nf someone could give me an idea where things stand I&#39;d be most\ngrateful. Qu=\r\nestions that spring to mind include:\n\nCan I use Cantera to model reactions =\r\nin liquids?\nIf not, how far off or broken is this functionality? \nIs anyone=\r\n working towards this?\nHow easy would it be for me to fix myself?\nIn the sh=\r\nort term, is there a work-around? e.g. some way to use\nideal_gas phase to g=\r\nive useful results?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nRichard West\n\n\nP.S.
