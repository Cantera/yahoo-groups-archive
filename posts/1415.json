Of course, they are right there in the CTI input file, so it  \nwould not be too hard to write a script to parse that and convert it  \ninto MATLAB matrices that could be read into MATLAB from a file.\n\nThe capability to access the coefficients was recently added in C++,  \nbut it has not yet made its way up to MATLAB or Python.\n\nIs it not accurate enough to simply do a finite-difference  \napproximation to dcp/dT, using a very small temperature difference?  \nThat is easy to do, unless there is some reason to do something more  \ncomplex.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Nov 24, 2006, at 9:15 AM, Michele Vascellari wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it exist in Matlab Cantera toolbox a method to evaluate the  \n&gt; partial\n&gt; derivative of specific heat with respect to the temperature (dcp/ \n&gt; dT), or\n&gt; at least a method to show the NASA polynomial coefficients of the\n&gt; mixture?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards\n&gt;\n&gt; Michele\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
