If=\r\n you need help to arrange the workshop I am willing to\ncontribute...\n\nBest =\r\nregards,\nMartin\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; At the first Cantera workshop in Chicago in 2004, we said s=\r\nomething \n&gt; about holding another one in conjunction with the Combustion Sy=\r\nmposium \n&gt; in Heidelberg in 2006.  Now we need to decide whether to do it o=\r\nr not.  \n&gt; I&#39;d like to get some sense of how useful people feel a Cantera w=\r\norkshop \n&gt; would be, and how many might attend if it were held in Heidelber=\r\ng on \n&gt; Sunday, August 6.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we do it, I would like much of the worksh=\r\nop to consist of \n&gt; contributed talks from Cantera users on what you are do=\r\ning with Cantera \n&gt; in research or teaching.  But of course I could talk ab=\r\nout future \n&gt; directions for Cantera (or whatever else people are intereste=\r\nd in) too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another option would be to hold a workshop somewhere else. =\r\n This might \n&gt; be preferred by non-combustion Cantera users, who wouldn&#39;t b=\r\ne in \n&gt; Heidelberg. (There&#39;s always the &quot;Westin La Cantera&quot; golf resort nea=\r\nr \n&gt; San Antonio, Texas...)\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know what you think, either by post=\r\ning to the user&#39;s group, or \n&gt; by sending me an email message.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,=\r\n\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
