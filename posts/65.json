So far I am \nimpressed with the program and would like to congratulate you on \nproducing this software. I notice in the Fortran manual that it should \nbe possible to perform reaction path analyses with the current version \nof Cantera however I have not managed to locate the appropriate module \nfor this. Any clues as to where I should look would be appreciated.\n\nI understand that currently sensistivity analysis cannot be performed \nwith Cantera, do you plan to add sensitivity analysis in the near \nfuture or are you focussing your development efforts in other areas?\n\nRegards\n\nRob Tranter\nDept.
