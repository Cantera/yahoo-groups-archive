I have been trying to run the cstr example\nposted in the files section.  However, when I try to run it as is, I\nget several errors of not recognizing functions.  I was able to fix\nthose problems by adding different headers to the #include section. \nHowever, now I am getting over 200 errors involving the non\nrecognition of many of the functions written in various classes.  As I\nhave not read a post that deals with any problems with this code, is\nthere a certain directory that I should be running the code out of, or\ncertain compile methods that I am not using.  Currently I am simply\ncompiling out of the include/cantera/ folder (where Cantera.h is) and\nusing the command g++ cstr.cpp.  If anyone knows how to get this\nworking, I would appreciate it.  \n\nThanks, \n\nAnup Misra\n\n\n\n"}}
