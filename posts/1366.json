I have also tried to change\n&gt; the includes in the file CVodesIntegrator.cpp to what is below but\n&gt; with no prevail.\n&gt;\n&gt;    The (partial) problem lies in the fact that the sundials package\n&gt; (it&#39;s called ) have a totally different naming convention than what is\n&gt; anticipated in Cantera.  The includes in the CVodesIntegrator.cpp file\n&gt; only unearths part of the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Further, look line 56 of the file /usr/include/nvector_serial.h,\n&gt; the include file is actually pointing at the wrong place\n&gt; (&quot;sundials_nvector.h&quot;).  What I cannot isolate, is whether the problem\n&gt; is with Cantera, cvnodes, or both.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Needless to say, I did not get any further, and I sincerely hope\n&gt; that I am wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers, Ed.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mlbeks1975&quot; &lt;mlbeks1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have been trying the latest SUNDIALS release ( Release 2.2.0, March\n&gt;&gt; 2006 ) on SUSE Linux 10.0. Some of the header files are in different\n&gt;&gt; places from the those in Cantera, and some have been renamed. I  \n&gt;&gt; already\n&gt;&gt; see an #ifdef OLD_SUNDIALS, but it appears that some more finegrained\n&gt;&gt; version matching may be needed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To get my version working I have patched CVodesIntegrator.cpp so it\n&gt;&gt; now reads:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; // sundials includes\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;sundials/sundials_types.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;sundials/sundials_math.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;cvodes.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;cvodes/cvodes_dense.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;cvodes/cvodes_diag.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;cvodes/cvodes_spgmr.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;cvodes/cvodes_band.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #include &lt;nvector_serial.h&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can anyone confirm this?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
