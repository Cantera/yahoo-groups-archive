The error-message \nin fluent is:\n\nOpening library &quot;libudf&quot;...\nError: open_udf_library:  _ZN3tpx6GetSubEi\nError Object: #f\n\nI&#39;m trying to do this on a linux-RedHat8.0-gcc/g++3.2-7 with fluent \n6.1.18, following the instructions in the README-file. The compiling \npart is ok (no errors). I also tried to set up my own case from \nscratch and follow the instructions in this thread, but I got the \nsame error.\n\nIf anyone knows what I&#39;m doing wrong or where the error might be, \nplease respond. If anyone have other examples available, I would \nappreciate very much if I could have them.\n\nThank you!\nMartin Olausson\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Vincenzo (or anyone else too),\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have a working example of how to use Cantera from Fluent, I \n&gt; could add the files in an appropriate place in the Cantera source \n&gt; distribution.
