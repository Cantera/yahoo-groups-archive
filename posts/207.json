For this, we need to add several new species for which\nthermo and transport data is fleeting.  I am using  group additivity  data\nto estimate thermo properties.  I am now at the point of trying to add NASA\ncoefficients into the &quot;cti&quot; file we are creating.  The problem is that I am\na bit confused about the form for the enthalpy that goes into the file.  The\ndocumentation (cti.pdf, Eqn. 4.2) suggests a slightly different form than\nthe old Chemkin-II approach.  (In particular, should the sixth coefficient\nbe divided by temperature.) I have started to reverse engineer by running\nthrough the same process with a known molecule, but I thought it might be\nboth more efficient to ask you, and clarify this for others as well.\n\n\n"}}
