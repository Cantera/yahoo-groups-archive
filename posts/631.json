Thank you so much!\n\n  I tested this on a XP machine without Fortran using VStudio .Net and \nwas able to run the matlab and python example scripts.  So far I have \nonly tested the zipped source code, and not tested the procedure with \ncode checked out of CVS.\n\nI encountered two problems, which I will document here and describe my \nquick fixes (better solutions are welcomed.)\n1. PROBLEM: The first problem occurred at the step of building \nsetup_cantera I get the following output\n----------------snip -------------------\n------ Starting pre-build validation for project &#39;SetupCantera&#39; ------\nERROR: Unable to find source file \n&#39;cantera-1.5.5&#92;Cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#92;Root&#39; for \nfile &#39;Root&#39;, located in \n&#39;[TARGETDIR]&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#39;, the file may \nbe absent or locked.\nERROR: Unable to find source file \n&#39;cantera-1.5.5&#92;Cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#92;Repository&#39; \nfor file &#39;Repository&#39;, located in \n&#39;[TARGETDIR]&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#39;, the file may \nbe absent or locked.\nERROR: Unable to find source file \n&#39;cantera-1.5.5&#92;Cantera&#92;matlab&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#92;Entries&#39; for \nfile &#39;Entries&#39;, located in \n&#39;[TARGETDIR]&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;@Kinetics&#92;private&#92;CVS&#39;, the file may \nbe absent or locked.\n------ Pre-build validation for project &#39;SetupCantera&#39; completed ------\n------ Build started: Project: SetupCantera, Configuration: Release ------\n------------------------------------ end snip ---------------------------\nSOLUTION:  My solution was to edit SetupCantera.vdproj in a text editor, \nremoving all sections referring to the CVS directories by hand.  I&#39;m not \nvery familiar with VStudio .NEt yet, so if there is a better way to edit \nthis file,  let me know.\n\n2.  PROBLEM: The second small error occurs when running the script \nrun_examples.m in matlab.  Everything seems to be going fin until \nPRANDTL2 dies with something like:\n************************************************\n                Cantera Error!                 \n************************************************\nProcedure: equilibrate\nError:   Jacobian is singular.\nTry adding more species, changing the elemental composition slightly,\nor removing unused elements.\n\nSOLUTION:  This is  *not* an indication of a bad build.  This only \nhappens when PRANDTL2 is run with a variable directly after PRANDTL1, \nwithout resetting the variable g.  Insert something like &quot;g=0;&quot; into \nline 26 of run_examples.m and it will run beautifully.\n  \n\nDavid Goodwin wrote:\n\n&gt;I have just changed the Cantera version number to 1.5.5, and posted a \n&gt;Windows source distribution at the sourceforge site \n&gt;(cantera-1.5.5-src.zip).\n&gt;\n&gt;The big news: Cantera can now be completely built  from within Visual \n&gt;Studio .NET, including the Python and MATLAB interfaces.  You can also \n&gt;create your own binary installer programs (.msi files) and distribute \n&gt;them to install Cantera (+ your own application code) on machines that \n&gt;do not have Visual Studio.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now there is no need to have cygwin (but personally I would install it \n&gt;anyway), or to do anything from a command line, or to have Fortran.  I \n&gt;think virtually all Windows installation problems should be gone now.  \n&gt;(Also, the Python location is no longer hard-wired to C:&#92;PYTHON23.)\n&gt;\n&gt;The procedure is described step-by-step in a Powerpoint presentation I \n&gt;have also posted at the Sourceforge site under &quot;Cantera Documentation&quot; \n&gt;- see file cantera-vc7.ppt.\n&gt;\n&gt;Other than that, you may notice a new class &quot;Mixture&quot; in Python, and a \n&gt;couple of new classes (MultiPhase and MultiPhaseEquil) in C++. These \n&gt;implement multi-phase mixtures and a new multi-phase equilibrium \n&gt;solver.  It is fully functional in Python and C++ now (MATLAB soon), \n&gt;but is not documented, so its official introduction will be in Cantera \n&gt;1.6 which will be out in January.  Cantera 1.6 will contain also some \n&gt;new phase models, and some improved support for non-ideal phases.\n&gt;\n&gt;Windows people in particular - if you have Visual C++ .NET, please try \n&gt;out the new build procedure, and report any problems.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
