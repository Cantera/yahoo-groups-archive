However, I&#39;m\ngetting weird =\r\nresults, and perhaps I&#39;ve tried to simplify things too\nmuch. Any suggestion=\r\ns would be gratefully accepted.\n\nI have a CTI file that contains:\n\nideal_ga=\r\ns(name =3D &quot;gas&quot;,\n          elements =3D &quot; O  H  Ar  E &quot;,\n          species=\r\n =3D &quot;&quot;&quot; nasa_gas: all&quot;&quot;&quot;,\n          options =3D [&quot;skip_undeclared_elements=\r\n&quot;],\n          reactions =3D &quot;all&quot;,\n          initial_state =3D state(temper=\r\nature =3D 300.0, pressure =3D OneAtm)\n          )\n\n\nIn my script file, I th=\r\nen initialize the plasma via\n\n    gas =3D importPhase(&#39;h2o2.cti&#39;)   \n    ga=\r\ns.set(T=3DT, P=3DP*OneAtm, X =3D &quot;O2:1,Electron:1&quot;)\n\nWhen I call gas.equili=\r\nbrate(&quot;TP&quot;) I had expected the mixture to go to\n0.5 moles of O2-. However, =\r\ninstead I&#39;m getting 1 mole of O2. I don&#39;t\nknow where the electron went. Can=\r\n anyone spot anything I might have\ndone wrong?\n\nThanks in advance (and happ=\r\ny Thanksgiving, for those in the US),\n\nRick\n\n\n\n\n"}}
