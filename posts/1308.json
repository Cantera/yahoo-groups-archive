For that I tried several things :\n1/ Modify the air.cti b=\r\ny adding H20 from water.cti but it doesn&#39;t work\nfor the two-phase of water =\r\n\n2/ try to make an ideal mix between O2,H20 and N2 but same pb as 1/\n3/ imp=\r\nort air.cti + water and then I have the two-phase for water but\nnot for the=\r\n mix ...\n\nWell as you can see I&#39;m lost !!! Any idea ? \n\nWhere I could find =\r\nsome explanantions for Cantera with python with at\nleast the list of possib=\r\nilities ? The doc is very frustrating with\nonly cpp and few examples in pyt=\r\nhon.\n\nTIA .... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
