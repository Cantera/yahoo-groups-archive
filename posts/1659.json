I have noticed Cantera=\r\n 1.2 don&#39;t \nhave any problem linking with that version of Fortran. Since cu=\r\nrrently \nI don&#39;t have any access to &quot;visual studio .net &quot; and Fortran&#39;s com=\r\npiler \nthat can be linked with Cantera 1.7, Would you please help me to fin=\r\nd \nCantera 1.2 source files.\nThank you in advance,\nHesam\n\n\n"}}
