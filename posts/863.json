DeCaluwe&quot; &lt;decal_12@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Arief,\n&gt; \n&gt; If I&#39;m not mistaken, you can enter the reaction twice, making sure \nto\n&gt; declare them as &quot;duplicate&quot; reactions, and give each declaration \none\n&gt; of the two terms as separate arrhenius rates; when cantera \ncalculates\n&gt; the reaction rates, it will take the sum of the two rates.  Page 37\n&gt; of &#39;cti.pdf&#39; in the cantera documentation explains it better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as an example of how to declare duplicate reactions, this is\n&gt; from the &#39;ptcombust.cti&#39; file that comes with cantera (though the\n&gt; rates aren&#39;t both arrhenius, here):\n&gt; \n&gt; #  Reaction 4\n&gt; surface_reaction(&quot;O2 + 2 PT(S) =&gt; 2 O(S)&quot;,   \n&gt;                   Arrhenius(1.80000E+21, -0.5, 0),\n&gt;                   options = &#39;duplicate&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; #  Reaction 5\n&gt; surface_reaction( &quot;O2 + 2 PT(S) =&gt; 2 O(S)&quot;,   \n&gt;                   stick(2.30000E-02, 0, 0),\n&gt;                   options = &#39;duplicate&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As an aside, I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a typo in your email, but the\n&gt; two exponential terms in your email are exactly the same \n&gt; { &quot;exp(+1.629/RT)&quot; }, in which case you could just factor them out \nto\n&gt; get one rate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Steven\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- aedahoe &lt;ae.dahoe@u...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Colleagues,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Reaction 15 of Marinov, Westbrook, Pitz scheme\n&gt; &gt; has the following expression for the reaction\n&gt; &gt; rate: k = 4.2e14*exp(+1.629/RT)+1.30e11*exp(+1.629/RT)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How can this be included in the .cti file?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With best regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arief\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
