We try that \nby the &quot;rundiamond.cpp&quot;( we&#39;ve found it in &quot;test_problems&quot; in \ncantera&#39;s web page), modified for our specific problems( we&#39;ve cut \nall concerning reaction rates cause we are interested only in \ncoverages) and by &quot;ptcombust.cti&quot; as input file.  \nWe have some questions: \n1)in order to obtain surface coverages variation data our temporal \nstep is too small (1.0e-15!!!).How is it possible? \n2)Which kind of &quot;reactor&quot; can we use (and its relative inlet \nparameters-temperature, coverages, gas molar fraction-)? \n \nthank you \n \n                      Simone & Matteo   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
