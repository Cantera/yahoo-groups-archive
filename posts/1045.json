On the MathWorks web site they have \ninformation about the compiler versions for various operating systems.\n\nThe problem may be related to changes in libstdc++ in gcc 4.x compared \nto gcc 3.x. As I understand it, libstdc++ in gcc 4 is a shared library, \nwhile in gcc 3 it was a static library. There are probably other \nincompatibilities between the two versions.\n\nSome linux systems maintain more than one version of the gcc compilers. \n  You may be able to specify which one to use in the Cantera &#39;configure&#39; \nscript, to match the one required by MATLAB.\n\nI&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be of more help, but currently I do not have access \nto a linux machine that has MATLAB installed, so I can&#39;t diagnose the \nproblem myself.  Has anyone else encountered and solved this problem?\n\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Nov 17, 2005, at 11:51 AM, chrtom1979 wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Mr Goodwin,\n&gt; I have successfully installed Cantera 1.6 under Suse Linux 10.0, but I\n&gt; still have problems using matlab interface, related to the version of\n&gt; GCC installed.
