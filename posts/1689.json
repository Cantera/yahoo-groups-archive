Using MixMaster\nwith Python, GRI-Mec=\r\nh 3.0, 1 mole of CH4 gets well divided into\nHydrogen, Acetylene and a varie=\r\nty of other gaseous hydrocarbons. \nWhat is peculiar is that two other therm=\r\no chemical calculators I have\nused, Gaseq and the NASA CEA calculator, pred=\r\nict a large concentration\nof solid carbon and gaseous hydrogen. Furthermore=\r\n an experiment was\ndone to dissociate Methane to produce carbon and hydroge=\r\nn at 1 atm at\nsimilar temperatures. The link is below and MixMaster used th=\r\ne way I\ndid yields different results. Does anybody have experience with usi=\r\nng\nCantera to predict dissociation of Methane?\n\nThanks,\n\nAlex\n\nhttp://www1.=\r\neere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/28890h.pdf \n\n\n"}}
