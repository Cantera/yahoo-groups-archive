As fas as I know, they are the same thing. I don&#39;t get\nany warnings when I compile Cantera. \n\n&gt; I have Digital Visual For6.0 (not Compaq VF6.0) and Micro Visual C \n&gt; 6.0. I was succeed to rebuild cantera.dsw under the directory of \n&gt; ./win32/ based on your cantera 1.3 C++ version, despite about 8000 \n&gt; warnings. \n\n\nMake sure CANTERA_ROOT is set. Also, make sure you have Cantera-1.3r1.\n\n&gt; When I run it,  I was informed by `input file gri30.inp not \n&gt; found in directory&#39;. Of course, I changed the system variables. \n\nThe MATLAB integrators, CVODE, and DASAC all agree. For examples using\nCantera with the MATLAB ODE integrators, see the MATLAB &#39;.m&#39; scripts in\nthe &#39;Cantera/matlab/cantera/examples&#39; directory.\n\n&gt; By the way, once you said that you used MATLAB integrators rather \n&gt; than CVODE to compare with DASAC. The results were in good agreement. \n&gt; What I am interesting is: Can cantera matlab version acts as an \n&gt; interpreter to form a couple of ODEFUN for matlab integrators such as \n&gt; the command [T,Y] = ODE15S(ODEFUN,TSPAN,Y0). If it can, how does it \n&gt; work? It will be excellent if you post the example using matlab \n&gt; integrators.\n\nThe reaction mechanism input files are in subdirectory &#39;data/inputs&#39;.\n\n&gt; Or can specify the exact file in cantera you used to read text file \n&gt; such as &quot;A+B+(M)=C+D+(M)&quot; and to form reaction rate? \n\n\n"}}
