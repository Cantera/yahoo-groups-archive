It appears that \nctbin.m is not included in the install, so one can make it based on \nan old post or edit code that calls it: ck2cti.m. Thoughts?\n  Also, I have an error that may have to do with my install as others \nin my class have not had the same problem with old versions, though \nthis is a repeat of post 449 that got no answer...\n  Using a ChemKin style input file, with thermo data built in, I try \nto create an ideal gas and get the following warning and error:\n\n1) WARNING - I am willing to skip this as it seems minor\n\n**** WARNING ****\nFor species CH3O2H, discontinuity in cp/R detected at Tmid = 1000\n\tValue computed using low-temperature polynomial:  14.1238.\n\tValue computed using high-temperature polynomial: 14.1516.\n\n\n2) ERROR - It will not run and this is a repeat from post 449:\n\n??? Error using ==&gt; Kinetics.Kinetics\n\n\n************************************************\n                Cantera Error!                  \n************************************************\n\n\nProcedure: getRateCoefficient\nError:   negative or zero A coefficient for reaction 80\n\n____________________\nHowever, I check out ck2cti.log and reaction 80 reads as follows:\nreaction 80\n   CH3O2 + CH3O2 =&gt; CH2O + CH3OH + O2\n   rate coeff:  A, n, E = (1.8E+012, 0, 0)\n\nSo A seems okay. Any thoughts?\n- Carl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
