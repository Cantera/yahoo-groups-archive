I=B4m using Cante=\r\nra mostly for research\n&gt; code development using plug-flow-reactors.\n&gt;\n&gt; My =\r\nquestion is, if it is now necessary to define a wall for an\n&gt; reactor to se=\r\nt the heat transfer to non-adiabatic values? If I use\n&gt; the &quot;setHeatTransfe=\r\nrCoeff()&quot;-function for an reactor it doesn=B4t have\n&gt; any effect.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anoth=\r\ner question is if you are planning to implement Sensitivity\n&gt; Analysis. The=\r\nre is an Code &quot;cvodes&quot; from sundials which offers some\n&gt; functionality in t=\r\nhis direction. If you want I will try to implement\n&gt; it in cantera on my ow=\r\nn and make some suggestions how you could make\n&gt; it official?\n&gt;\n&gt; Third que=\r\nstion: is it possible to construct flame between two\n&gt; opposing nozzles (li=\r\nke oppdif in CH*MKIN) from the one-dim class?\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope it isn=B4t to much=\r\n and look forward to your answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; ulf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------=\r\n----------------- Yahoo!
