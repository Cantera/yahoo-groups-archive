The purpose of this is only to detect spammers who  \nwant to send the group members spam about the usual things - wonder  \ndrugs, hair restorers, etc.\n\nUnfortunately my natural professorial absent-mindedness has been  \ngreatly accentuated in the last few months by some medications I have  \nto take (temporarily).  As a result, I often forget to look at the  \nlist of pending messages until several weeks have gone by.  I think  \nYahoo groups tend to be magnets for scammers.... When I check the  \npending messages list, there is quite often one or two spam messages  \nthat I delete so that you never see them\n\nMy suggestion: Try using the Forums at SourceForge.Net.   Just go to  \nwww.cantera.org, select &quot;SourceForge&quot; and when the Cantera  \nSourceForge page comes up, select &quot;Forums&quot;.  Let me know what you  \nthink - is this an effective way to get your problems solved quickly?\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
