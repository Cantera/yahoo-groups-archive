At the moment I have checked only the matlab demo.\n&gt; Some problems:\n&gt; 1. I was need to turn off &quot;boost&quot; option. They was on in CVS version\n&gt; which I downloaded today. In spite that I have boost instaled it gaves\n&gt; the following error:\n&gt;\n&gt; g++ -pthread -shared build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.5/src/pycantera.o\n&gt; -L/home/sergey/src/cantera171/cantera/build/lib/x86_64-unknown- \n&gt; linux-gnu\n&gt; -L/usr/lib64 -L/home/sergey/sundials/lib -L/usr/local/lib\n&gt; -L/usr/lib/python2.5/config -lclib -luser -loneD -lzeroD -lequil\n&gt; -lkinetics -ltransport -lthermo -lctnumerics -lsundials_cvodes\n&gt; -lsundials_nvecserial -lctbase -llapack -lblas -lctmath -ltpx -lctf2c\n&gt; -lconverters -lboost_thread-mt-1_34 -lctf2c -lctf2c -lm -lpython2.5 -o\n&gt; build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.5/Cantera/_cantera.so\n&gt; /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.1.2/../../../../x86_64-suse- \n&gt; linux/bin/ld:\n&gt; cannot find -lboost_thread-mt-1_34\n&gt; collect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. It is possible to compile only with f2c option. Using g77 or\n&gt; gfortran  gives undefined symbols: printstring_ for g77\n&gt; or_gfortran_stop_numeric.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Problem with f2c was in the 64 bit version: I was needed to add\n&gt; manually -fPIC in CFLAGS in all makefiles in etc subdirectories:\n&gt; f2c_math, f2c_lapack, etc. There is probably the better way to do it.\n&gt; But after this change all is working.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Sergey.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cantera 1.7.1 is ready to be checked out from CVS for unix/linux/Mac\n&gt;&gt; users. It is probably best to check out a fresh working copy, rather\n&gt;&gt; than update an existing one. The new features are:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1. Thread safe build option.  Cantera can optionally be built to be\n&gt;&gt; thread safe, which insures that static data (e.g. cached error\n&gt;&gt; messages) are modified by only one thread at a time. This option\n&gt;&gt; requires the Boost thread library (which is why it is not the\n&gt;&gt; default).  You can download Boost from www.boost.org.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2. Faster chemical equilibrium. The equilibrium routines were\n&gt;&gt; spending quite a bit of time writing detailed logfiles. Now this can\n&gt;&gt; be turned off, or completely compiled out of the code.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Both of these options may be set in the preconfig script. Please\n&gt;&gt; report any build problems with this new version.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
