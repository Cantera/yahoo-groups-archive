Most of this is actually in the cvs version of Cante=\r\nra right now. I hope to complete a report on this capability within the mon=\r\nth, where I verify that the\nEQ3 database is ported correctly. This work is =\r\nlocated in the thermo directory in the module HMWSoln.\n\nThis is mostly ther=\r\nmochemistry.  Liquid reactions are possible, though I haven&#39;t generated any=\r\n examples yet. I have several examples of common electrodes, showing that C=\r\nantera can produce the correct interface voltages, i.e. E_r&#39;s. Also, I have=\r\n not yet generated transport in brines, though that is likely the next thin=\r\ng I will tackle.\n\nNote, this is all in the C++ layer of Cantera. I haven&#39;t =\r\nadded interfaces for matlab and python yet.\n\nI will also be adding constitu=\r\ntive models for lithium salts in the near future. If you would like to help=\r\n, let me know! All aboard. It&#39;s a big job, and I could use the help.\n\nThere=\r\n is also an ideal solution interface as well.\n\nBest wishes,\nHarry\n\n\n\nHarry =\r\nMoffat                                             (w) (505) 844-6912\nNanos=\r\ncale and Reactive Processes            (f)   (505) 844-8251\nSandia National=\r\n Laboratories                                    hkmoffa@...\nP.

I have started to poke\naround in the source code, and it at fi=\r\nrst glance it looks as if\nsome/much/all of the solution phase code is missi=\r\nng.\n\nEventually I will want to worry about solubilities, phase separation,\n=\r\netc. but for now an ideal solution will be a useful start.\n\nIf someone coul=\r\nd give me an idea where things stand I&#39;d be most\ngrateful. Questions that s=\r\npring to mind include:\n\nCan I use Cantera to model reactions in liquids?\nIf=\r\n not, how far off or broken is this functionality?\nIs anyone working toward=\r\ns this?\nHow easy would it be for me to fix myself?\nIn the short term, is th=\r\nere a work-around? e.g. some way to use\nideal_gas phase to give useful resu=\r\nlts?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nRichard West\n\n\nP.S.
