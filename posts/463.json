RedHat \nlinux should come with python preinstalled, but it may appear as \n&#39;python2&#39;. Make sure python is on the path, or else define environment \nvariable PYTHON_CMD to equal the full pathname for python, and then run \n&#39;configure&#39; again.\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Aug 2, 2004, at 7:29 AM, johnny374z wrote:\n\n&gt; I am trying to install Cantera 1.5.4 on a RedHat linux system.
