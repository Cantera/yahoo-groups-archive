In other words, \nwith ne=\r\nw thermodynamic properties your system is already in \nequilibrium and there=\r\nfore, does not change with time. To test this, \ntry to change the thermodyn=\r\namic properties very gradually and look \nwhat will happen. Other possibilit=\r\nies such as very small time step, \nwrong reinitialization of an object etc.=\r\n could not be excluded though.\n\nBest regards, Anatoli. \n\n--- In cantera@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;dottorato82&quot; &lt;daniele.chiappini@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi to all,\n=\r\n&gt; I would like to simulate a combustion process in a piston and I&#39;ve\n&gt; alre=\r\nady simulated it like a reactor with a moving wall obtaining \ngood\n&gt; result=\r\ns. However, I am now trying to simulate the combustion process\n&gt; with a ser=\r\nies of adiabatic reactors because I need to do some\n&gt; operations on the the=\r\nrmodynamic properties between two timestps. At\n&gt; the end of every timestep =\r\nI save variables like gas temperature,\n&gt; pressure and composition and, afte=\r\nr doing what I need to do, I\n&gt; re-initialize a new reactor with the initial=\r\n conditions which I&#39;ve\n&gt; computed. Doing it I&#39;ve encountered a big problem:=\r\n the reactor \nafeter\n&gt; the first timesetp doesn&#39;t evaluate the chemestry in=\r\n it. In other\n&gt; words it modifies the composition of the mixture only in th=\r\ne first\n&gt; timestep, during the others it doesn&#39;t do anything regarding the\n=\r\n&gt; reactions in it so I cannot evaluate the correct behavior of the gas\n&gt; du=\r\nring the compression and expansion strokes.\n&gt; Somebody has ideas or suggest=\r\nions about it?\n&gt; Thank you very much for your help and your willingness.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Daniele\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
