For higher pressures I would prefer GRI-2.=\r\n1\nMech. It gives better fit with experiments. Maximum flame temperature\ncan=\r\n not help you. I think it does not depend on mechanism because it is\nthermo=\r\ndynamic function. \n\nBest regards,\nMike\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: ca=\r\nntera@yahoogroups.com [mailto:cantera@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\nOf bruno56=\r\n740\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2006 8:49 PM\nTo: cantera@yahoogroups.com\nSubj=\r\nect: [cantera] different flame speeds with different reaction\nmechanisms\n\n\n=\r\nDear Cantera users,\n\nI am unexperiemented with this great software and hope=\r\n I will find \nsome help with the following dilemma.\n\nTo compute the laminar=\r\n flame speed, I use the file adiabatic_flame.py\n\nFor a stoichiometric CH4/a=\r\nir mixture, using the mechanism GRI30, I \nobtain a flame speed of 38.2cm/s\n=\r\nHowever, when I use the C2 mechanism of San Diego University, the \nresult i=\r\ns 32.5cm/s\nWhy such a difference? Those two mechanisms have anyway good \nag=\r\nreement on flame temperature and species gradients.\n\nHere is the modificati=\r\non I made to incorporate the San diego \nmechanism in the .py file:\n\ngas =3D=\r\n IdealGasMix(&#39;san_diego.cti&#39;)\n#gas =3D GRI30(&#39;Mix&#39;)\ngas.addTransportModel(&#39;=\r\nMix&#39;)\n\nMoreover, those results seem to me under-estimating the CH4/air \nlam=\r\ninar flame speed. I would have expected values closer to 40cm/s.\n\nThank you=\r\n very much for your help and comments.\n\nBruno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Lin=\r\nks\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
