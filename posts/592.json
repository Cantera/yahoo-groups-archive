I have opened the \nconverter in &#39;Command Prompt&#39;  but an error message appears when I \nenter any command/option. \n\nI am using the python interface and want to include solid carbon (as \nproduct, not catalyst) in a chemical equilibrium reaction. \n\nAny other suggestions?\n \nAlso, I wanted to know where we could find a python manual?  I found \nthat the &#39;Documented python code&#39; link on the Cantera website does \nnot work. \n\nThanks, \n\nEkta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
