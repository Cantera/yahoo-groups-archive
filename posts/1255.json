Its=\r\n not a big deal guys. Just \nautomatisation of running 1-D flamecalculations=\r\n, calculating Zeldovich \nnumbers and Lewisnumbers (similar to smooke) and f=\r\nlamethickness as \nwell. I have not cleaned up the routines so that its not =\r\nthat easy to \nunderstand. I will do that and than I will post it in the can=\r\ntera \ngroupe or in the matlab newsgroup.\n\nCheers for an answer of the secon=\r\nd part\n\nSven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
