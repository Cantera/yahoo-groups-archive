I  know we can carry out a reaction at\nconstant temperature if we set energy=&quot;off&quot; in a\nreactor so that the energy equations are not\nintegrated. But my question is how do I calculate the\ntotal energy change in a constant temperature process.\nI need to calculate the total energy evolved if I\ncarry out a certain reaction at constant temperature?\n\nSurinder\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
