The\n&gt; paper is:\n&gt; \n&gt; D. G. Goodwin, &quot;An open-source, extensible software suite for CVD\n&gt; process simulation,&quot; Proceedings of CVD XVI and EuroCVD Fourteen,\n&gt; Electrochemical Society, 2003 (in press).\n&gt; \n&gt; A preprint is available at\n&gt; http://blue.caltech.edu/cantera_dist/doc/cantera_ecs2003.pdf.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Here are a few answers to recent questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. I haven&#39;t installed Visual Studio .NET yet, so don&#39;t know if \nthere\n&gt; are issues getting Cantera to compile with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Cantera may not work with Matlab 5 (haven&#39;t tried it). Also, if \nyou\n&gt; are using a Matlab 6 version other than the one used to build the \nMatlab\n&gt; toolbox in the release, you will need to rebuild the Matlab \ntoolbox.\n&gt; This can be done from within Matlab. You need a C compiler \nconfigured to\n&gt; work in Matlab (do &#39;mex -setup&#39;). Go to the Cantera toolbox \ndirectory,\n&gt; and type &#39;buildwin&#39; or &#39;buildunix&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. The new version of Cantera no longer requires setting \nenvironment\n&gt; variables under Windows. (But for what its worth, in Windows 98 \nyou have\n&gt; to edit AUTOEXEC.BAT and reboot. A better solution: upgrade to Win \n2000\n&gt; or Win XP...)\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Chemical equilibrium calculations require a sufficient number of\n&gt; species in the reaction mechanism. Otherwise, method &#39;equilibrate&#39; \nwill\n&gt; fail with an error message. At a minimum, you need as many species \nas\n&gt; elements, and these must span &#39;element space.&#39; That is, any mixture\n&gt; elemental composition must be achievable for some set of species \nmole\n&gt; fractions. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, compositions that correspond to exactly stoichiometric \ncombustion\n&gt; often cause &#39;equilibrate&#39; to fail to converge, since the \nequilibrium\n&gt; composition is a very sensitive function of equivalence ratio \nhere. The\n&gt; solution is to move away a very small amount from this composition.\n\n\n"}}
