All you need to do is pop up the graphical Python module  \ndocumentation browser that comes with Python. On Windows, it is on the  \nPython sub-menu of the Start menu. On other systems, type &#39;pydoc -g&#39;. A  \nsmall window should appear on the screen. Press the button &#39;open  \nbrowser&#39; in this window. A browser window will appear showing a  \ndocument that has links for all installed Python modules. Scroll down  \nuntil you find &#39;Cantera&#39; and follow this link. You will see links for  \nall of the modules in the Cantera package.  The gas object belongs to  \nclass Solution, defined in module &#39;solution&#39;. Follow the &#39;solution&#39;  \nlink and you will find a complete list of all of the methods you can  \nuse with gas objects.  Let me know if this doesn&#39;t answer your  \nquestions.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Nov 6, 2003, at 7:06 PM, Houston Miller wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been running the opposed flow code from Python and have an  \n&gt; interest\n&gt; in extracting some additional information to calculate mixture  \n&gt; fraction and\n&gt; local scalar dissipation rate.  I could do it in Excel, but I thought I\n&gt; could just do some of the calculations in Python and add a column for\n&gt; mixture fraction to the csv file that is written.  Seems like I should  \n&gt; be\n&gt; able to call out something like the mass fraction for a particular  \n&gt; element,\n&gt; or the number of hydrogen atoms that that species has, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t been able to figure out the nuances of syntax for the gas  \n&gt; object,\n&gt; or how python should tease them out.  (I have figured out things like\n&gt; gas.meanMolecularWeight () , and getting the full list of Species  \n&gt; Names,\n&gt; etc.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have a few minutes, could you give me a quick and dirty on the\n&gt; structure of the gas object?  (Or maybe send me a reference to the  \n&gt; correct\n&gt; header file that could clear it up).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Houston Miller\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
