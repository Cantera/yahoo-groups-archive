This ONLY occurs if ALL of the  \nfollowing are true:\n\n1. the reaction is reversible\n2. the reaction has four or more product molecules\n3. the stoichiometric coefficient for some product species is greater  \nthan one.\n\nIf any of these conditions is NOT true (rxns with three or fewer  \nproduct molecules, or ones in which all product molecules are  \ndifferent species) WILL NOT have this problem. And of course since it  \nONLY affects reverse rates of progress, not forward ones,  \nirreversible reactions do not have this problem.\n\nThe essence of the problem is that if the above conditions are met,  \nthen the concentration products for the reverse rate in the law of  \nmass action are computed with exponents of 1.0, rather than the  \nproduct stoichiometric coefficients.  The reactant concentration  \nproducts and equilibrium constants are always computed correctly.  \nThis affects both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions.\n\nIn general, this will only impact simulations with global reactions  \nmodeled as reversible, since hardly any elementary reactions have  \nfour or more products.\nA reaction for which this problem occurs is the global reforming  \nreaction\n\nCH4 + H2O &lt;=&gt; CO + 3 H2\n\nsince it has 4 product molecules, and the H2 stoichiometric  \ncoefficient is greater than 1.  It may be easily verified that at  \nequilibrium, the reverse rate does not equal the forward rate, as it  \nmust.\n\n\nFix\n=====\n\nIf you want to do it yourself, edit file Cantera/src/ \nReactionStoichMgr.cpp, and change line 116 to read:\n\nm_revproducts-&gt;add(rxn, r.products, r.pstoich, r.pstoich);\n\ninstead of:\n\nm_revproducts-&gt;add(rxn, r.products, m_dummy, r.pstoich);\n\n\n\nThe CVS repository has been updated with this fix.\n\nThanks to Andrew Colclasure at Colorado School of Mines for pointing  \nout the problem.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
