The issue about the\npis=\r\nton velocity in Matlab has been in this forum for quite sometime,\nwith appa=\r\nrently no solution yet. Has anyone received/found the\nsolution for this par=\r\nticular problem? How would you construct a moving\npiston Cantera reactor in=\r\n Matlab? I would appreciate any reply or help\non this issue. Thank you in a=\r\ndvance for your kind attention and support.\n\nBest Regards,\nPeter Perez\n\n---=\r\n In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;deep_champ007&quot; &lt;deep.g1985@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi=\r\n all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using cantera with matlab.\n&gt; I am trying to simulate IC eng=\r\nine \n&gt; combustion using cantera.\n&gt; I got a code in python from Proff.\n&gt; Goo=\r\ndwin for the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone tried to simulate the engine\n&gt; using can=\r\ntera with matlab?\n&gt; \n&gt; as there is no operator to assign velocity\n&gt; to pist=\r\non in Matlab, how do we model\n&gt; the engine\n&gt; \n&gt; Hoping for replies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Si=\r\nncerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; Deep Gupta\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
