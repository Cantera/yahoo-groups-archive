I changed \nthe G=\r\nRI30.cti file to include only the additional species.  I \nfigured I first a=\r\ndd the species, and if successful, then add the \nreaction.  I am using the =\r\nGRI mechanism in the &quot;Flame2&quot; python demo \nmodule.  After adding the specie=\r\ns (C14H30), &quot;flame2&quot; is now \nreturning the following error message...\n\n\n***=\r\n*********************************************\n                Cantera Error=\r\n!                  \n************************************************\n\n\nProc=\r\nedure: parseCompString\nError:   unknown species C14H3\n**********\n\nI do not =\r\nunderstand why the unknown species name is &quot;C14H3&quot; rather \nthan the C14H30?=\r\n  Is the problem in the GRI30 file or did the GRI30 \nfile alter another fil=\r\ne that is now a problem?  \n\nRelated to this...  When I changed the GRI30.ct=\r\ni file...  Are \nthere &quot;species lists&quot; in other files (perhaps thermo or tra=\r\nnsport \nfiles) that are also updated?  \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated,\n\n=\r\nThanks, Lucas\n\n\n\n\n"}}
