I&#39;m glad you think it will be \nuseful. I don&#39;t know much about Delphi, but from what you say it \nsounds like I should learn more. The graphical flame &#39;wrapper&#39; you \nwrote sounds very interesting - when you have it ready, I&#39;d like to \nsee it.\n\nSetting up the counterflow flame problem is easy. It is already there \nin C++, but I need to finish up the Python interface for it. Once I \nget past this week&#39;s program review (fortunately the last one), I&#39;ll \nhave some time to work on Cantera again and will write the Python \ninterface for counterflow flames.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n"}}
