T=\r\nhese are quite stable. They don&#39;t have nitrogen chemistry.\nBut if you are s=\r\npecifically looking for GRI3.0 reduced mechanisms the\nDRMs may not be the a=\r\nnswer.\n\nThere are also some Augmented Reduced Mechanisms (ARMs) based on\nGR=\r\nI1.2 and GRI2.11, I think you can get them through the GRI website.\nHowever=\r\n, these are not in chemkin format (they are coded in fortran).\nThey are har=\r\nd-coded into Fluent, so if you are using that I can email\nyou instructions =\r\non how to tap into it.\n\nNote that GRI have stopped supporting GRI2.11 and b=\r\nelow, although some\nCFD codes cannot accept &gt;50 species so if you want to u=\r\nse full\nchemistry, GRI2.11 is all you can go up to (49 species).\n\nIf you wa=\r\nnt to find reduced mechanisms based on GRI3.0, you may need\nto trawl some a=\r\ncademic journals to see who&#39;s done the most recent\nones. I&#39;m not familiar w=\r\nith any.\n\n(GRI-Mech web site, http://www.me.berkeley.edu/grimech)\n\nThe foll=\r\nowing references have other mechanisms you can try (based on\n2.11 and 1.2):=\r\n\n\nA Skeletal mechanism, 16 species, 41 reactions\nS.
