Did somebody succeed in \nthese cal=\r\nculations with Soret effect? If yes, I would really appreciate \nif you help=\r\n me to pin down the problem by providing with the \ncomposition of the unbur=\r\nned mixture, chemical mechanism and the \ncalculated values of the burning v=\r\nelocity for the all three \n(&quot;Mix&quot;, &quot;Multi&quot; and &quot;Multi&quot; with Soret) transpor=\r\nt models.\n\nThank you, \nAnatoli Mokhov   \n\n\n\n"}}
