Since Reactor objects can have any number of  \ninlets, a mixer is just a reactor with 2 inlets and one outlet. If you  \nwant to turn off chemistry in the mixer, use a reaction mechanism with  \nno reactions for it. The 2 inlet streams can use different reaction  \nmechanisms - species are matched by name.\n\nI&#39;ve posted 2 example Python scripts at  \nhttp://blue.caltech.edu/cantera_dist/examples/python\nThe first (mix1.py) does a mixer with no chemistry, and the second one  \n(mix2.py) adds an igniter to ignite the fuel/air mixture.\n\nYou&#39;re right, &#39;blue&#39; was off the network for a while.  I couldn&#39;t  \nfigure out why it was not reachable over the network (and rebooted  \ntwice to try to cure it) until I happened to glance at the wall outlet  \nand notice that one RJ45 cable was disconnected and was lying on the  \nfloor... I plugged it in, and suddenly &#39;blue&#39; was cured.\n\nBy the way, if anyone (other than me) is interested, the SourceForge  \ncount for the number of downloads of Cantera is wrong.  It has  \nincorrectly listed the number of downloads as zero for several days  \nnow.  This bug in their software is affecting other projects too, and  \nthey are working on it.\n\nAlso... I&#39;m running behind schedule on releasing the new version with  \nflames in Matlab. It&#39;s almost ready, but it will probably be next week  \nbefore I release it.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, May 29, 2003, at 07:28 AM, silvershadow112002 wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking into a way to pre-mix two different gases before putting\n&gt; them into a reactor.
