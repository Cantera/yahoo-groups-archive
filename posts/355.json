To understand what happens I looked\n&gt; at the specific enthalpy (molar enthalpy divided by mean molecular\n&gt; weight) at every grid-point and saw that it is going down. So, if at\n&gt; every grid point is the same mass flow where is the energy ? Isn&#39;t the\n&gt; flame adiabtic ?\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; ulf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
