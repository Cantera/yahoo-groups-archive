The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; paper is:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D. G. Goodwin, &quot;An open-source, extensible software suite for \nCVD\n&gt; &gt;&gt; process simulation,&quot; Proceedings of CVD XVI and EuroCVD \nFourteen,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Electrochemical Society, 2003 (in press).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A preprint is available at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://blue.caltech.edu/cantera_dist/doc/cantera_ecs2003.pdf.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Here are a few answers to recent questions:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. I haven&#39;t installed Visual Studio .NET yet, so don&#39;t know if\n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are issues getting Cantera to compile with it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. Cantera may not work with Matlab 5 (haven&#39;t tried it). Also, \nif\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are using a Matlab 6 version other than the one used to build \nthe\n&gt; &gt; Matlab\n&gt; &gt;&gt; toolbox in the release, you will need to rebuild the Matlab\n&gt; &gt; toolbox.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This can be done from within Matlab. You need a C compiler\n&gt; &gt; configured to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; work in Matlab (do &#39;mex -setup&#39;). Go to the Cantera toolbox\n&gt; &gt; directory,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and type &#39;buildwin&#39; or &#39;buildunix&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. The new version of Cantera no longer requires setting\n&gt; &gt; environment\n&gt; &gt;&gt; variables under Windows. (But for what its worth, in Windows 98\n&gt; &gt; you have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to edit AUTOEXEC.BAT and reboot. A better solution: upgrade to \nWin\n&gt; &gt; 2000\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or Win XP...)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. Chemical equilibrium calculations require a sufficient \nnumber of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; species in the reaction mechanism. Otherwise, \nmethod &#39;equilibrate&#39;\n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fail with an error message. At a minimum, you need as many \nspecies\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; elements, and these must span &#39;element space.&#39; That is, any \nmixture\n&gt; &gt;&gt; elemental composition must be achievable for some set of species\n&gt; &gt; mole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fractions.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, compositions that correspond to exactly stoichiometric\n&gt; &gt; combustion\n&gt; &gt;&gt; often cause &#39;equilibrate&#39; to fail to converge, since the\n&gt; &gt; equilibrium\n&gt; &gt;&gt; composition is a very sensitive function of equivalence ratio\n&gt; &gt; here. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; solution is to move away a very small amount from this \ncomposition.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
