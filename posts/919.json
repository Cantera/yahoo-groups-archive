As I have discussed before, I am using several nested\n&gt; loops to calculate the equilibrium molar mass of a gas mixture, then\n&gt; the time it takes to reach this molar mass, and then store the data\n&gt; and start the calculation over at a new initial temperature.  After\n&gt; about 5 temperature increments, equilibrate returns the error:\n&gt;\n&gt; ???

I have tried using cleanup and individually\n&gt; clearing all of the variables except for the loop variables and the\n&gt; one storing my data, but it does not work.  Do you have any\n&gt; suggestions?  Would it be possible in future Cantera releases to\n&gt; modify the cleanup command so that the user can choose which C++\n&gt; Cantera objects to delete?\n&gt; Thank you very much for any advise you can offer.\n&gt; Jeff Miller\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps this is a MATLAB problem. In MATLAB, there is no way that\n&gt; I can\n&gt;&gt; find to delete the C++ Cantera object when the MATLAB &#39;shadow&#39;\n&gt; object\n&gt;&gt; is deleted (cleared).  So if you create lots of Cantera objects in\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; MATLAB workspace, it can consume memory that is not released even\n&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; you type &#39;clear all&#39;.  I have provided a function &#39;cleanup&#39; that\n&gt;&gt; deletes ALL Cantera objects.  If you use &#39;cleanup&#39;, you must also\n&gt; clear\n&gt;&gt; all Cantera objects from the MATLAB workspace, since they cannot\n&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; used once the underlying C++ objects are deleted.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Or it could be a problem due to using MATLAB 6.5, since the\n&gt; Windows\n&gt;&gt; Cantera MATLAB toolbox was compiled with MATLAB 7.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If MATLAB gives you problems, you could do your calculation in\n&gt; Python,\n&gt;&gt; which has better capabilities for memory management.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dave\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Jun 28, 2005, at 9:19 AM, chrtom1979 wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Mr Goodwin,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I finally manage to use the mixture equilibrate command (I work\n&gt; with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Matlab6.5 in Windows environment) using Cantera1.6.
