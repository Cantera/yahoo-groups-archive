The reason is a high inlet gas \n=\r\ntemperature. Approximately, the adiabatic flame temperature increases \nas t=\r\nhe preheating temperature divided by two. You preheat more than \n1000 K you=\r\nr unburned gas mixture, therefore, the flame temperature \nshould be around =\r\n2000 + 1000/2 ~ 2500 K. More importantly, I am \nafraid that the temperature=\r\n of the unburned gases could not \ncorrespond to the physical reality. It se=\r\nems that this temperature is \nabove the mixture&#39;s autoignition temperature.=\r\n In this case it means \nthat this mixture can exist only very short (a few =\r\nmilliseconds or \nless) time before autoignition.\n\nBest regards, Anatoli \n\n-=\r\n-- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;changye_liu&quot; &lt;changyeliu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Dear all, I am new in Cantera and I try to use the demo code \n&gt; flamespeed=\r\n to calculate the flame property. The fuel is CH4, CO, N2 \n&gt; and H2O mixtur=\r\ne. The initial temperature is 1373K. But the result \n&gt; seems to be crazy. T=\r\nhe adiabatic temperature is over 2500K and the \n&gt; flame speed is 6 m/s. Tha=\r\nt&#39;s impossible I think. So there should be \n&gt; something wrong in the code t=\r\nhat I have not found. Please help me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I change the initial temperature=\r\n by these:\n&gt; \n&gt;     doublereal temp =3D 1373.0; // K\n&gt;     doublereal press=\r\nure =3D 1.0*OneAtm; //atm\n&gt;     doublereal uin=3D0.3; //m/sec\n&gt;     .\n&gt;    =\r\n .\n&gt;     .\n&gt;     flame.setFixedTemperature(1400.0);\n&gt; \n&gt; I think maybe I sh=\r\nould change uin here. But nothing changes after \n&gt; doing so. What&#39;s the pro=\r\nblem?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much!!!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
