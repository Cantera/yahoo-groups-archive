I started \nfrom the dus=\r\ntygas.py example, and modified it to set the gas \ncomposition and pressure =\r\nto different values for the state1 and state2 \nparameters of the molarFluxe=\r\ns() function. While the program runs and \nreturns results, the results fail=\r\n some elementary reality checks, like \nthe direction of species flows.\n\nHav=\r\ne I oversimplified the problem here? I&#39;ve assumed that creating a \ngas, set=\r\nting the transport manager and then the states is all that is \nnecessary to=\r\n solve my problem.
