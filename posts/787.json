Likewise, if I \ncut and paste the whole command in a DOS window, it appears to \nexecute without an error.\n\nI did download the 1.5.5r4 source and built the files and the .msi \ninstaller.  Unfortunately, I still get the same errors.\n\n----Mark\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Mark,\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect the problem is that the Cantera Python extension module \nwas \n&gt; built to link to one version of the Python DLL, and can&#39;t be used \nwith \n&gt; a different version.  Try running the temporary Python file that \n&gt; ct2ctml creates, and see what error message it gives you.  If this \nis \n&gt; the problem, you can build it from the source with whatever Python \n&gt; version you like.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
