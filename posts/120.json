In fact,  \nit&#39;s funny you bring it up now, because I&#39;m finishing up a short note  \non just that topic, and will release a new version this week that will  \ncontain a demo of using Cantera with Fortran 77.  In fact, if all you  \nneed is gas-phase thermo + chemical production rates, the demo contains  \na ready-to-use library of the Fortran-callable functions you need.\n\nIn the new version of Cantera, the Matlab toolbox contains only one MEX  \nfile that must be compiled. Hopefully this will simplify porting it to  \nScilab or Octave. I can&#39;t personally commit to working on that, due to  \ntime constraints, but welcome anyone else who is interested in  \ndeveloping interfaces for Scilab, Octave, or anything else.\n\nThe new version should be out very soon - maybe today, but more likely  \ntomorrow.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 15, 2003, at 08:56 PM, steve@...  \nwrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My main work is done on a linux machine.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am considering switching from Chemkin II to cantera but don&#39;t\n&gt; have a Fortran-90 compiler.\n&gt;\n&gt; The manual is not really explicit about what functionality will\n&gt; be unavailable without  F90 compiler.\n&gt; I would be happy to program completely in C++/python  if\n&gt; that&#39;s a reasonable option.\n&gt;\n&gt; If F90 is really required, there seem to be many choices.\n&gt; Intel has a fullfeatured eval download, and there are others --\n&gt; any advice?\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, while I&#39;m here --\n&gt; given that Cantera is open source, how about\n&gt; an interface to Scilab, or Octave (both matlab replacements).\n&gt; I have a crude interface between Chemkin II and scilab\n&gt; and will  at least scope out a cantera&lt;-&gt;scilab connection.\n&gt;\n&gt; \t\tThanks\n&gt; \t\t\tSteve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
