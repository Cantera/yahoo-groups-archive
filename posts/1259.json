I ha=\r\nve the \nCVS version cantera which I can load (cvs has vc++ 2003 files) into=\r\n \nvc++ 2005.\n\nProblem is that vc++ 2005 (both the express &#39;free version&#39; or=\r\n the \nstandard version) dont support &#39;vdproj&#39; type files for the setup and =\r\n\ndeployment of cantera. Instead &#39;oneclick&#39; deployment is available. Only \nt=\r\nhe professional version supports this, which I dont have.\n\nDoes anyone know=\r\n how to deploy cantera using this &#39;oneclick&#39; method?\n\nThanks to anyone who =\r\ncan help. \n\nAdam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
