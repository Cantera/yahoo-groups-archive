As you have found, this \ncan lead to convergence problems of some algorithms at the midpoint \ntemperature.  The best thing to do is to modify the polynomial \ncoefficients very slightly to make cp/R and h/RT continuous. \nAlternatively, you can simply avoid using methods like setState_UV \n(which iterates using Newton&#39;s method) very close to the midpoint \ntemperature.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Oct 19, 2004, at 7:53 PM, prabhjot102 wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; I am trying to carry out a simulation for ethanol hydrogasification.\n&gt; The kinetics, transport and thermodynamics data is taken from the\n&gt; llnl file which is available in the files section.
