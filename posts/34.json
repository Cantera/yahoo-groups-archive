It is currently configured only for building Fortran \napplications, but now does not require you to have Visual C++. \n\nSee http://www.cantera.org/howto/getting_started.htm for details on \nhow to install Cantera and build Fortran applications with Compaq \nVisual Fortran. The process is now very simple and you should be up \nand running in less than a couple of minutes.\n\nIt comes with an executable program that does zero-D kinetics, which \nrequires no programming at all. Look in the &quot;Cantera Examples&quot; folder \non the desktop, go to the zero-D kinetics folder, and double click \nzero.exe. It should run a hydrogen/oxygen ignition simulation using \nGRI-Mech 3.0, and produce an Excel-readable CSV file with the \nresults. You can also use your own mechanisms. More example programs \nwill be added soon.\n\nThe Cantera Fortran manual is also included in the distribution.\n   \n\n\n"}}
