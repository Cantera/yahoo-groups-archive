Does \nCantera use the equations of \n\nenergy balance, Arrhenius equation or another? How the numeric \ncourse of calculations introduces \n\n? \nI have to describe in simple way, a imathematical and numerical \nsolving question in my graduate \n\nwork. Coul you help me or specify where can I find specyfic \ninformation? \n\nP.S. I have succesfully ended simulations using Cantera.I studied \ndependence of fuel composition \n\nand lamda on formation precursors of polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons in a premixed laminar flame \n\nwith Marinow kinetic mechanism n-butane.   \n\nbest regards\n\nSteve Patyk \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
