I expect the \nsolution would be some form of creating a Cantera mixture object\n(i.e. &quot;heavyweight&quot; reaction-mechanism object, as per earlier \ndiscussion of copying objects to track multiple states), extracting \nthe pointer to this object in a form that Simulink can treat as a \nnumber, combining it with the numerical state information to make a \n&quot;plain&quot; vector representation that Simulink can pass around, and then \nreconstructing the relevant mixture objects from this within each \nSimulink block.  This seems like a rather complicated wheel to \nreinvent if someone&#39;s already done it, though, particularly if there \nare complications to it that I haven&#39;t forseen!\n\nSo: Has anyone on the list done this (or something similar) already, \nand if so can you offer some advice and perhaps examples of how to \nmake this work?  Does the potential solution that I have seem like \nit&#39;s on the right track, and are there any nonobvious pitfalls I \nshould look out for?\n\nThanks much,\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n"}}
