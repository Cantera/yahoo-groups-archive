Originally, I selected &#39;c:&#92;programs&#92;python23&#92;&#39; to install\nPython in for the sake of organization.  Likewise, Cantera was placed\nin &#39;c:&#92;programs&#92;cantera154&#92;&#39;.  Today I noticed that the error\nstatement was indicating &#39;c:&#92;python23&#92;python&#39; despite the PATH being\nset to &#39;c:&#92;programs&#92;python23&#92;&#39;.  Therefore I reinstalled python to\n&#39;c:&#92;python23&#92;&#39; and Cantera so it would recognize the change. \nApparently, then is it correct to assume that Python has to be\ninstalled only in &#39;c:&#92;python23&#92;&#39; folder for Cantera to work correctly\non Win system?\n\nThank you,\n-Tom\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~Error indication ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n************************************************\n                Cantera Error!                  \n************************************************\n\nProcedure: ct2ctml\nError:   could not convert input file to CTML\n command line was: c:/python23/python\nC:&#92;DOCUME~1&#92;tps&#92;LOCALS~1&#92;Temp/.cttmp1101161994.pyw&gt; ct2ctml.log 2&gt;&1\nError in Python installation\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, David Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tom -\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know what the problem is.  Cantera usually installs fine on \n&gt; Windows PCs and everything runs.  Something about your system \n&gt; configuration must be non-standard, but I don&#39;t know what - some \n&gt; environment variable setting, for example.  Maybe try undefining\nboth \n&gt; TMP and TEMP.  Or see if an older version of Cantera works on your \n&gt; system.  You could also try installing on someone else&#39;s PC to see\nif \n&gt; it is a problem specific to your machines.  Lots of people install \n&gt; Cantera using the Windows binary installer without problem, so I\ndon&#39;t \n&gt; think it is anything fundamental in Cantera or in the install \n&gt; procedure...\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n"}}
