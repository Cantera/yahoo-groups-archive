The calls\n\ngas = gri30  (or oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, or water, for that\nmatter)\n\nwork only because functions have been written (as mfiles, assuming\nyou&#39;re using matlab) that in turn make the appropriate &#39;importPhase&#39;\ncalls.  Again, assuming you&#39;re using matlab, look in the folder\n&#39;matlab&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera,&#39; and you&#39;ll see the functions GRI30.m,\nhydrogen.m, etc.\n\nI&#39;m sure somebody else here can help you with ck2cti.\n\nBest of luck,\nSteven\n\n\n\n--- Jonathan Woolley &lt;jmwoolley@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;d like to use a reaction mechanism converted from ck format to\n&gt; cti\n&gt; using ck2cti.exe, except I am having trouble implementing the\n&gt; mechanism as an object through Matlab. This is probably a simple\n&gt; question, but I am a new Cantera user so please bear with me!\n&gt; \n&gt; The Matlab tutorials show that I can..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; gas1 = GRI30\n&gt; \n&gt; .. and the GRI30.cti will be loaded as an object, I can define it&#39;s\n&gt; characteristics, equilibrate, etc.  Alternatively I can..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; gas1 = importPhase(&#39;GRI30.cti&#39;,&#39;GRI30&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; .. and similarly it will be loaded as an object.\n&gt; \n&gt; For certain other .cti mechanisms included with Cantera I can load\n&gt; the\n&gt; object, but for others I cannont. For example...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; gas1 = importPhase(&#39;Argon.cti&#39;,&#39;Argon&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; .. will load the mechanism as an object, but..  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; gas1 = importPhase(&#39;h2o2.cti&#39;,&#39;h2o2&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; .. returns a nasty error that I don&#39;t really understand..\n&gt; \n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt;                 Cantera Error!                  \n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Procedure: xml_find_id\n&gt; Error:   id not found: h2o2\n&gt; \n&gt; Error in ==&gt; XML_Node.findByID at 4\n&gt; index = ctmethods(10, 8, root.id, id);\n&gt; \n&gt; Error in ==&gt; Solution.Solution at 34\n&gt;   node = findByID(doc,id);\n&gt; \n&gt; Error in ==&gt; importPhase at 7\n&gt;   s = Solution(file, name);\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; .. So I&#39;ve created a .cti mechanism &quot;octane.cti&quot;, converted by way\n&gt; of\n&gt; ck2cti.exe, and it&#39;s saved with the other .cti mechanisms in\n&gt; C:&#92;...&#92;Cantera&#92;data. I want to load it as an object and run\n&gt; equilibrium calculations for a range of mixtures.  So when I\n&gt; attempt\n&gt; to (similar to the tutorial for gri30)..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; gas1 = octane \n&gt; \n&gt; ??? Undefined function or variable &#39;octane&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; .. and when I ..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; gas1 = importPhase(&#39;octane.cti&#39;,&#39;octane&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt;                 Cantera Error!                  \n&gt; ************************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Procedure: xml_find_id\n&gt; Error:   id not found: octane\n&gt; \n&gt; Error in ==&gt; XML_Node.findByID at 4\n&gt; index = ctmethods(10, 8, root.id, id);\n&gt; \n&gt; Error in ==&gt; Solution.Solution at 34\n&gt;   node = findByID(doc,id);\n&gt; \n&gt; Error in ==&gt; importPhase at 7\n&gt;   s = Solution(file, name);\n&gt; \n&gt; .. So what am I missing? I&#39;m guessing I just don&#39;t yet fully\n&gt; understand the fundamentals of how Cantera functions, but I haven&#39;t\n&gt; found any documentation that expains this situation. Thanks for the\n&gt; help!\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; Jonathan\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
