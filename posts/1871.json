I mean, instead of give the\n&gt; composition as:\n&gt;\n&gt; gas.set(T = 900.0, P = 1.0e5, X = &#39;CH4:1,O2:2,N2:7.52&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; We could give something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; gas1.set(T = 900.0, P = 1.0e5, X =  \n&gt; &#39;CH4:mole_CH4,O2:mole_O2,N2:mole_N2&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Where mole_CH4, mole_O2 and mole_N2 are previously calculated as a\n&gt; function of the fuel injection rate, mass air flow and equivalence\n&gt; ratio. Any hint or experience on this will be much appreciated. Thank\n&gt; you very much for your kind attention.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards, Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
