It was just a path  \nproblem. I was compiling with g++ 4.0.2, but was trying to link to an  \nearlier version of the stdc++ library.  When I put in the correct  \npath to the 4.0.2 libraries (by specifying LCXX_FLAGS in the  \n&#39;preconfig&#39; script), Cantera built fine, and the demos work.\n\nSo, as far as I know, there are no problems with building Cantera on  \nlinux.  The latest version of Cantera (available only through CVS)  \nshould also correctly link to sundials 2.2.0.\n\nDave\n\n\n"}}
