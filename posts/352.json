We need to do computational modeling to complement\nthe experimental effort. The Python scripts distributed with Cantera\nprovide a good description of the gas flow and flame front. The\nability to include the interaction of water drops with the flow field\ndoes not appear to be present. How difficult would it be to add this\nability to Cantera and what would be the best approach to do so?\nUnfortunately, my programming experience is primarily in Fortran.\n\nThanks for any advice that you can provide.\n\nRick\n\n==========================================\nDr. Richard C.
