I&#39;m seeing a problem that I think goes back to Cantera. \nThe problem =\r\nI&#39;m having is with the call getEnthalpy_RT(MassFracs).  It\nlooks like when =\r\nthe temperature is set with setTemperature(Temp) and\nthat temperature is ou=\r\ntside the range of applicability (as dictated by\nthe input mechanism file) =\r\n-- low, in my case -- the fit is used at the\ngiven temperature, instead of =\r\nat the limit, which is what I expected.\n\nI was curious what should be retur=\r\nning from Cantera when\ngetEnthalpy_RT(MassFracs) is made and setTemperature=\r\n(Temp) has been\nset outside the defined range of applicability for a given =\r\nfit.
