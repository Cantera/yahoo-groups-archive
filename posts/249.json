My work involves modeling of energy systems, \nadvising graduate students and assessment of energy analysis \nsoftware.  I do some work with Brooks Moses, Matt Svrcek and Patrick \nCaton (all members of the users group).\n\nI&#39;ve been working on writing an interface for cantera/MATLAB that \nwill use &quot;lightweight&quot; objects (see Brooks&#39;s post of 8/18/2003) and \nthat will be accessible to graduate students (1st year master&#39;s \nlevel) in a class on thermodynamic modeling.  I&#39;ve noticed that \nCantera has a limited number of ways to set state variables.  For \nexample, one can set Temperature and Pressure simultaneously, but \nnot Temperature and Entropy.  While it was relatively easy to write \nmy own functions to perform the appropriate calculations, it is a \nbit confusing that Cantera accepts the command to set said variables:\n\ngas = gri30\ns0 = entropy_mass(gas)\nT0 = temperature(gas)\ns1 = s0\nT1 = T0 + 100\nset(gas,&#39;T&#39;,T1,&#39;S&#39;,s1)\n\nbut returns no warning that temperature was set, entropy input was \nignored, and density was held fixed.\n\nI see that this &quot;quirk&quot; is referenced to some extent in the C++ \nusers guide, but it is my opinion that the interface should also \nreturn a message when it is unable to appropriately respond to the \nuser&#39;s input.\n\nLet me know if there is any way that I can help.\n\n-A.J. Simon\n\n\n\n"}}
