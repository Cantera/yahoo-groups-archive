Note that space is limited, so please register early \nif you want to attend.\n\nThe morning will be a tutorial, focusing on using Cantera from Matlab \nand/or Python, but could also cover C++ if there is sufficient \ninterest.  CDs will be available with the latest versions of Cantera \nand supporting software for Windows,, Mac OS X,  and linux, plus all \nworkshop materials.  If you bring your laptop (optional), you can \ninstall/upgrade Cantera on the spot and work along with the tutorial.\n\nin the afternoon, there will be an opportunity for some of you to \ndescribe how you are using Cantera.  If you are using Cantera in \nteaching, or in research, or in other ways, please consider giving a \nshort (~15 minute) presentation about your application.  On your \nregistration form, note at the bottom any topic you would be interested \nin presenting, and I&#39;ll contact you about it.\n\nWe will finish by 3 pm at the latest.  Hope to see you there.\n\n\nDave\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-2--533589216\r\nContent-Type: application/pdf;\n\tx-mac-type=50444620;\n\tx-unix-mode=0644;\n\tname=&quot;canteraworkshop.pdf&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n\tfilename=canteraworkshop.pdf\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Apple-Mail-2--533589216\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n\tcharset=US-ASCII;\n\tformat=flowed\r\n\r\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-2--533589216--\r\n\n"}}
