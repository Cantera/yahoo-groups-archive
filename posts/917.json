So, I am now able to use the &quot;clear all&quot; and \nthe &quot;cleanup&quot; commands either at the end of each loop, or right\nbefore \nequilibrate.  However, this did not improve the memory problem at \nall!  With all variables and C++ Cantera objects deleted, shouldn&#39;t \nequilibrate run just as if it were by its self, and not in a \ncomplicated loop?  After about 5-10 temperature increments, \nequilibrate still crashes Matlab, and I have to exit and restart the \nprogram in order to do anything.  Do you have any suggestions?  How \nmuch better is Python at memory management?  Would it be worth \nswitching to Python? \nThank you very much for any help you can offer.\nJeff Miller\n\n\n\n"}}
