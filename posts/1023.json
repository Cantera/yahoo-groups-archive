Also, although this is probably not strictly necessary, \noften this transformation from u to T is done in a way that is specific \nto a particular equation of state (e.g. ideal gas).  The formulation in \nterms of u works in principle for any equation of state.  That having \nbeen said, however, it would probably not be hard at all to create a \nmodified Reactor class that was formulated in terms of T rather than u. \n  Would this be useful to have?\n\nBy the way - I have just implemented sensitivity analysis for reactor \nnetworks.  It is not released yet, but it should be later this week. It \nwill allow you to compute the sensitivity of any species (gas or \nsurface) in any reactor in the network, with respect to any reaction \n(homogeneous or heterogeneous) in any other reactor in the network (or \nthe same one).\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Nov 6, 2005, at 11:24 PM, albrechtheinzel wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Prof. Goodwin,\n&gt; I have a general question about the reactor-class. The set of governing\n&gt; equations you review briefly in the &quot;cantera-introduction.pdf&quot; contains\n&gt; an internal energy balance equation. Therefore you need to solve every\n&gt; time step an implicit formulation to derive the temperature. What is\n&gt; the reason you don&#39;t transform it in an equation with temperature as\n&gt; the independent variable?
