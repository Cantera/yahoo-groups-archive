I mean, instead of give the\nc=\r\nomposition as:\n\ngas.set(T =3D 900.0, P =3D 1.0e5, X =3D &#39;CH4:1,O2:2,N2:7.52=\r\n&#39;)\n\nWe could give something like:\n\ngas1.set(T =3D 900.0, P =3D 1.0e5, X =3D=\r\n &#39;CH4:mole_CH4,O2:mole_O2,N2:mole_N2&#39;)\n\nWhere mole_CH4, mole_O2 and mole_N2=\r\n are previously calculated as a\nfunction of the fuel injection rate, mass a=\r\nir flow and equivalence\nratio. Any hint or experience on this will be much =\r\nappreciated. Thank\nyou very much for your kind attention.\n\nBest Regards, Pe=\r\nter\n\n\n\n"}}
