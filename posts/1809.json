The problem is that I have to approve the  \nposts from new members who have not previously posted, in order to  \ncheck that they are not spammers. Once I see that the message is  \nlegit, I approve it.  And if I remember to do it, I change the  \nsender&#39;s profile so that he/she can post without requiring approval.   \nUnfortunately, due to lots of other committments, days can go by  \nbefore I check on pending messages requiring approval...\n\nIf you are experiencing a delay in a post you have submitted, send me  \nan email directly reminding me to check for pending messages... And  \nif you want to get authorized to post without my prior approval, send  \nme a message too.  If your e-mail address appears legit (a  \nuniversity, research lab, or company that would legitimately use  \nCantera) then you&#39;ll be approved and can see your posts show up  \nimmediately. For example, &quot;jim@...&quot; would be approved  \nbut not  &quot;jim@...&quot;,  If you&#39;re using a Yahoo,  \nGmail, or other account, then you&#39;ll have to wait until you do one  \nmoderated post, since spammers use these email accounts quite a bit.\n\nAnd finally - to all Cantera users:  Happy New Year!\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
