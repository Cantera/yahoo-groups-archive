In addition to the issues with converting to the\nnew compiler ver=\r\nsion (various spurious warnings), it seems like there\nhas been a reorganiza=\r\ntion of the Cantera source files which required\nquite a few changes to the =\r\nproject files. \n\nI was able to get the Cantera to compile cleanly (apparent=\r\nly) with my\nmodified project files, and I was wondering it would be useful =\r\nfor me\nto provide these files, or whether there are other plans to update t=\r\nhe\nprovided Visual Studio project files.\n\n\n"}}
