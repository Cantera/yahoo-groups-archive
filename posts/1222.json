It\nseems to me=\r\n that one could augment the normal kinetics that come out\nof a GRI reaction=\r\n mechanism with a Saha equation calculation of the\nionization process. Howe=\r\nver, this would require that electrons be\ntreated as actual species in the =\r\nreaction mechanism, and I don&#39;t know\nwhether there are serious problems in =\r\ndoing this. Can anyone comment\non the suitability of this type of a model?\n=\r\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRick Muller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
