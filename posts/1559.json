One possibility is to get  \nthe Python source code and compile it yourself, but I haven&#39;t tried  \nthis on Windows, so I don&#39;t know how compatible the Python source is  \nwith Visual Studio 2005.  The same problem occurs with respect to the  \nMATLAB toolbox, but of course there is no option to compile MATLAB  \nfrom source.  The only solution is to use Visual Studio 2003.\n\n\nOn Mar 15, 2007, at 3:32 PM, pughpatrick wrote:\n\n&gt; I have tried following Dr. Goodwin&#39;s instructions for the windows\n&gt; installation.  At the end of the build solution, I get 2 errors.\n&gt; These errors are related to Python 2.5   The error message indicates a\n&gt; problem with Visual Studio 2005 (professional ed) not being able to\n&gt; read some python files.  It says the Python files were created with\n&gt; Visual Studio 2003 and it (2005 version) can not read them.  The error\n&gt; message indicates that use of cygwin  -c mingw32 for recompiling the\n&gt; (python) setup.py file might help.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a bit stumped by this. Is this typical for a normal windows\n&gt; installation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
