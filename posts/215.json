In particular, I tried to do the following:\n\n=3D=3D=3Dbegin=3D=3D=3D\n\n=\r\n=B7\tPut the full path to the Python interpreter (e.g. C:&#92;PYTHON23&#92;PYTHON.EX=\r\nE) on the PATH environment variable, or else set environment variable PYTHO=\r\nN_CMD to the path to the interpreter.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3Dend=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nSo I we=\r\nnt to Windows: System Properties, Advanced, Environment Variables, System V=\r\nariables and put in the following System Variable:\n\nPYTHON_CMD -&gt; C:&#92;PROGRA=\r\n~1&#92;PYTHON23&#92;\n\nI continued the install, and ran one of the MATLAB demos.  I =\r\ngot a number of errors, so I went back in to System Properties, Advanced, E=\r\nnvironment Variables, System Variables and appended the following to my pat=\r\nh:\n\n;C:&#92;PROGRA~1&#92;PYTHON23\n\nand also edited the PYTHON_CMD System Variable a=\r\ns follows:\n\nPYTHON_CMD -&gt; C:&#92;PROGRA~1&#92;PYTHON23&#92;PYTHON.EXE\n\nOnly after a reb=\r\noot did the MATLAB M-file work, but I got several warnings/errors.  I got f=\r\nour (4) in a row of the following messages just before I was told my CPU ti=\r\nme:\n\n=3D=3D=3Dbegin=3D=3D=3D\n\n&#39;C:&#92;PROGRA~1&#92;PYTHON23&#39; is not recognized as a=\r\nn internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3Dend=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nI assume that this is not a good thing, and I need to r=\r\ne-compile Python scripts or something to get this error to go away.\n\n1.  Wh=\r\nat do I do, short of an uninstall/re-install\n\n2.  Dave--  you might want to=\r\n clean up that install message to read:\n\n=3D=3D=3Dbegin=3D=3D=3D\n\n=B7\tInclu=\r\nde the full path to the Python interpreter (e.g. ;C:&#92;PYTHON23) on the PATH =\r\nenvironment variable, or else set environment variable PYTHON_CMD to the fu=\r\nll path and file name of the interpreter (e.g. C:&#92;PYTHON23&#92;PYTHON.EXE).\n\n=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3Dend=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nTIA,\n\n--Keith\n\nGiner Electrochemical Systems\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
