This is a \ncollaborative program between Caltech, Colorado School of Mines, Fluent \nInc., and NRL.  The work will make heavy use of Cantera in C++ and \nPython, and will require strong programming / software skills, coupled \nwith a strong background in chemistry, chemical engineering, materials \nscience, and/or applied physics. Experience with modeling reactive \nsystems (combustion, CVD, fuel cells, ...) is desirable.  The position \nis available essentially immediately.\n\nAnyone who is potentially interested should contact me directly \n(dgoodwin@...).\n\n\n\n"}}
