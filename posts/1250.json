For  \nexample, the Python flame demo script &#39;flame2.py&#39; could be modified  \nas follows:\n\nf.set(energy = &#39;off&#39;)\nf.setRefineCriteria(ratio = 10.0, slope = 1, curve = 1)\nf.setMaxJacAge(50, 50)\nf.setTimeStep(1.0e-5, [1, 2, 5, 10, 20])\n\n#---------- inserted lines -----------\n\n# make a list of fractional distances (i.e., 0 = burner, 1 = opposite  \nend of domain)\n# where T will be specified\n\nlocations = [0.0, 0.1, 0.12, 0.13, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9,  \n0.99, 1.0]\n\n# a list of T values corresponding to the positions above\n\ntemperatures = [400.0, 450.0,  (skipping intermediate values),  2000.0]\n\n# call setProfile to fix the temperatures at these locations\nf.setProfile(&#39;T&#39;, locations, temperatures)\n\n#-----------------------------------------\nf.solve(loglevel, refine_grid)\n\n\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1.  The BurnerFlame class has a method &#39;init()&#39; that sets default  \ninitial temperature and species profiles.  But this method is not  \ninvoked if &#39;setProfile&#39; is\ncalled by the user.  So this means that if you set one profile  \n(temperature), you need to set profiles for the species too. These  \ncan be very simple - the init()\nmethod uses only 3-point profiles.  It is worth taking a look at  \nBurnerFlame.py in the Cantera python package to see how this is done  \nthere. To set species profiles, use the species name in the call to  \nsetProfile:\n\nloc = [0, 0.5, 1.0]\nx = [0.01, 0.04, 0.0]\nf.setProfile(&#39;OH&#39;, loc, x)\n\n\n2. For the species profiles, they are only used for the initial  \nestimate of the solution.  But for temperature, as long as the energy  \nequation is disabled [ set(energy  = &#39;off&#39;) ] then this profile will  \nbe used as the fixed temperature profile throughout the solution.\n\n3. Each profile can use a different array of locations. These values  \nwill be interpolated onto the actual grid, and in the case of  \ntemperature will be re-interpolated every time the grid is refined.  \nFor this reason, you will probably want to specify temperature on a  \ngrid with many points (corresponding to experimental data points),  \nbut use a very small grid to specify the initial species profiles.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\nOn Jun 10, 2006, at 12:22 AM, Sergey Cheskis wrote:\n\n&gt; I am just starting my move from chemkin to cantera.
