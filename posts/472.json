So far it is only \navailable in the &quot;bleeding edge&quot;  version available for check-out by \nCVS. It currently implements thermo properties, transport properties, \nequilibrium, and kinetic rates for bulk phases, but will soon do the \nsame for interfaces. Type &#39;ctnew -f90&#39; to copy to your directory a demo \nFortran 90 program and makefile, then simply edit the makefile to \nreplace the demo code with your Fortran 90 code.\n\nThe basic idea is shown here:\n\nprogram demo\nuse cantera\ntype(phase_t) gas\ngas = importPhase(&#39;gri30.cti&#39;,&#39;gri30&#39;)\n..\nnsp = nSpecies(gas)\ndo i = 1, nsp\n    call getSpeciesName(gas, i, name)\n    write(*,*) name, moleFraction(gas, i)\nend do\n...\nThe procedure calls are very similar to those in the Cantera MATLAB \ninterface.  See the demo.f90 program for more things you can do, and \nlook at the files in Cantera/fortran/src, particularly &#39;cantera.f90&#39; \nand &#39;cantera_xxxx.f90&#39;, where &#39;xxxx&#39; is &#39;thermo&#39;, or &#39;kinetics&#39;, or ...\n\nDocumentation is coming soon. This has only been tested so far with NAG \nf95 on Mac and linux systems. Probably the Makefiles will need to  be \ntweaked for other compilers.\n\n\n2) A new option for specifying reaction rate coefficients will be \navailable soon, which will allow specifying sums of Arrhenius terms, \ni.e. kf = sum_n (A_n T^(b_n) exp(-E_n/RT)).  This will hopefully \neliminate the need to declare duplicate reactions solely to model \nnon-Arrhenius behavior\n\n\n3) I have started a separate CVS module for reaction mechanisms in \nCantera CTI format.  It only has a few mechanisms so far,  but I plan \nto add more.   Only mechanisms that have been published and validated \nin some manner will be included, and each file contains a citation to \nthe paper(s) and possibly web site where it is discussed.  If you have \na validated, published mechanism you would like to have included in \nthis repository, send me either the CTI file, or the Chemkin \n(mechanism+thermo+transport) files, or send me the URL for these.\n\nIf you want to check out the repository, do &quot;cvs co reactionmechs&quot; \nusing the same CVSROOT you us for anonymous check-out of cantera from \nCVS.  You can also browse the repository via the web by going to the \nCantera sourceforge site and download individual files.\n\n\n4) Finally, I am going on vacation for 2 weeks. While I may \noccasionally check e-mail,  it won&#39;t be often, and it is likely that \nposts to the user&#39;s group will go unanswered (by me at least) for a \nwhile. This is a good opportunity for other experienced Cantera users \nto step in and answer the questions of new users ...\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n"}}
