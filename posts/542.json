When I run the \nprogram I get a warning which I have pasted here:\n\n\n**** WARNING ****\nFor species ch2chch2o, discontinuity in cp/R detected at Tmid = 1000\n\tValue computed using low-temperature polynomial:  18.0127.\n\tValue computed using high-temperature polynomial: 18.3387.\n**** WARNING ****\nFor species ch2chch2o, discontinuity in h/RT detected at Tmid = 1000\n\tValue computed using low-temperature polynomial:  21.2183.\n\tValue computed using high-temperature polynomial: 21.169.\n\n\nI was still able to carry out the simulation earlier. But now I was \ntrying a different program in which I am observing the temperature \nvariation and incidently the program gives an error when the \ntemperature reaches a value very near 1000K. The error is:\n\n\n?? \n\n************************************************\n                Cantera Error!                  \n************************************************\n\n\nProcedure: setState_UV\nError:   no convergence. dt = -0.000204342\nu = -6.10327e+006 v = 0.185101\n\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;cantera154\n&#92;matlab&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;ctmethods.dll\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;cantera154\n&#92;matlab&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Reactor&#92;private&#92;reactormethods.m\nOn line 6  ==&gt;   v = ctmethods(60, n, job, a);  \n\nError in ==&gt; c:&#92;cantera154\n&#92;matlab&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;cantera&#92;@Reactor&#92;advance.m\nOn line 22  ==&gt; reactormethods(8, reactor_hndl(r), tout);\n\nError in ==&gt; C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;surinder&#92;My \nDocuments&#92;Cantera154&#92;constantpreactor.m\nOn line 24  ==&gt;     advance(r,t);\n\n\n\nCan anyone suggest some remedy for this. I am thinking of finding \nsome way to change the ao-a6 coefficients for ch2chch2o minutely \nsuch that the cp/R and H/RT value at 1000K converges. \n\nSurinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
