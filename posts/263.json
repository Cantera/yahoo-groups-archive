You can use the \nMatlab function setMultiplier to do this:\n\nsetMultiplier(gas, rxn_number, value);\n\nBy default, the multiplier for each reaction is 1.0.\n\nYou can&#39;t change the activation energy dynamically, but there is an \nundocumented feature of surface reactions that I think will do what you \nwant. You can specify the coverage dependence of both the \npre-exponential and of the activation energy.  This was added after I \nreleased the document on cti file syntax, so isn&#39;t described there (or \nanywhere else).  I&#39;ve attached a short description of how to do this.  \nSee also file ptcombust.cti that uses this feature.\n\nAs far as adding other, non-Arrhenius rate laws, it is not hard to do \nbut requires adding the appropriate code in the Cantera C++ kernel.  If \nyou tell me what you want, I&#39;ll see if I can do it for the next \nrelease.\n\nDave\n\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-12--146696193\r\nContent-Type: application/pdf;\n\tx-unix-mode=0644;\n\tname=&quot;coverage.pdf&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n\tfilename=coverage.pdf\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Apple-Mail-12--146696193\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n\tcharset=US-ASCII;\n\tformat=flowed\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jan 22, 2004, at 8:29 AM, y2kpac wrote:\n\n&gt; Once a cti file is called, is there a way to change one or more of\n&gt; the rate coefficients of one or more of the reactions (i.e. a Matlab\n&gt; command)?
