We are \ntrying to develp a plug flow reactor model for catalytic (on Pt \nsurface) partial methane oxidation, which can be expressed by : \nCH4+0.5O2=CO+2H2. I noticed that someone has already posted a \nmessage about PFR model and you mentioned that we can use dz=V(gas)\n*dt to convert the zero-dimentional model to a plug flow reactor. \nHere, I have several questions about the zero dimentional model \nsurfreactor.m:\n\n1) Is the kinetics also valid for the Partial Oxidation of Methane \non Pt surface, or, where did u get the original kinetics of the Pt \ncombustion?\n\n2) In surfreactor.m, you wrote:\n\nt = 870.0;\ngas = importPhase(&#39;ptcombust.cti&#39;,&#39;gas&#39;);\n\n% set the initial conditions\nset(gas,&#39;T&#39;,t,&#39;P&#39;,oneatm,&#39;X&#39;,&#39;CH4:0.02, O2:0.21, N2:0.784&#39;);\n\nsurf = importInterface(&#39;ptcombust.cti&#39;,&#39;Pt_surf&#39;, gas);\nsetTemperature(surf, t);\n\nDoes this mean you set both the Pt wall surface and the inlet gas as \nthe same temperature? If the answer is yes, why should we do like \nthat, cause, I think the inlet gas might enter the reactor in a much \nlower temperature and be heated by the hotter wall until it reaches \na considerable high temperature to ignite the reaction.\n\n3) You wrote:\n\nsetArea(w, 1.0e-4);\nsetHeatTransferCoeff(w,0.1);\n\nI am just wondering how the parameters, like 1.0e-4 and 0.1 comes \nfrom? Cause in our system, we might have significant different \nvalues of the catalyst surface area as well as the heat transfer \ncoefficient.\n\nThank you very much for your time.\n\n\nTengfei\n\nDept. of Chemical Engineering,\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
