Could you look at that too?\n\nThanks for your work.\n\nZhiwei\n\n\n--- In cantera@y..., Jay Jeffries &lt;Jeffries@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello Dave,\n&gt; If I open this PDF I can read it from my netscape, but when I try\nto print it\n&gt; my computer crashes.

If you are having problems with something,\nit\n&gt; &gt;is likely someone else is too.

Have you tried the Python\n&gt; &gt;interface? Or CtLib? How did they work? etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A final note: much of the Cantera web site will be down tomorrow\n&gt; &gt;morning due to a necessary power shutdown in the building housing\nthe\n&gt; &gt;host machines.
