I&#39;m modeling combustion with a\ncst=\r\nr and want to ignite the mixture with a variable mass flow rate (to\ninject =\r\nH atoms) or a variable heat flux through a wall, using the\ngaussian functio=\r\nn in Cantera. However, the mass flow rate is zero for\nall times (massFlowRa=\r\nte()), and the same happens with the heat flux.\n\nCan anybody help me?\n\nMy M=\r\natlab code:\n\nigniter =3D Reservoir(gas)\nmfc_ign =3D MassFlowController;\nmdo=\r\nt_ign =3D gaussian(1, 1, 2); \ninstall(mfc_ign, igniter, cstr);\nsetMassFlowR=\r\nate(mfc_ign, mdot_ign);\n\nand\n\nw =3D Wall;\nhot =3D Reservoir(gas);\ninstall(w=\r\n, cstr, hot);\nsetArea(w, 1.0);\nheat_flux =3D gaussian(1000, 1, 10);\nsetHeat=\r\nTransferCoeff(w, heat_flux)\n\nThank you very much!\n\nSebastian Goeke\n\n\n\n--- I=\r\nn cantera@yahoogroups.com, Bhupinder Singh &lt;bsingh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I&#39;ve been having trouble getting an igniter gaussian pulse in a \n&gt; coti=\r\nnually stirred\n&gt; reactor model in Matlab.\n&gt; \n&gt; The &quot;Reactors&quot; file from Can=\r\ntera Workshop explains a Python \n&gt; example, which clearly uses a functor to=\r\n get a gaussian pulse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Python:\n&gt; igniter_mdot =3D Gaussian(t0 =3D 1, F=\r\nWHM =3D 0.2, A =3D 1) (Functor)\n&gt; m3 =3D MassFlowController(upstream =3D ig=\r\nniter, downstream =3D \n&gt; combustor, mdot =3D igniter_mdot)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying =\r\nto use a similar approach in Matlab.\n&gt; \n&gt; Matlab:\n&gt; \n&gt; igniter_mdot =3D @(t=\r\n) Gaussian(t,0.01,1,0.2);\n&gt; (Functor for Gaussian pulse)\n&gt; \n&gt; igniter_contr=\r\noller =3D MassFlowController;\n&gt; install(igniter_controller, igniter, combus=\r\ntor);\n&gt; setMassFlowRate(igniter_controller, igniter_mdot);\n&gt; \n&gt; (The Gaussi=\r\nan function, wasn&#39;t available in the Cantera \n&gt; distribution.
