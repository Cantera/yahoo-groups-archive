I seem to b=\r\ne\nrunning into two problems.\n\n1) When I run with all three input files, the=\r\n program seems to run\nfine, the log file says that the program has been suc=\r\ncessful and I can\nsee that it has processed the reactions and the thermodyn=\r\namic data,\nbut I get no output. The program just sits there and does not re=\r\nturn\nthe output data or the command prompt. \n\n2) The mechanism that I am mo=\r\nst interested in using does not have \ntransport data (I don&#39;t need it). The=\r\n program seems to crash when the\ntransport file is not included. If I check=\r\n the log file it appears\nthat everything up through the thermo data and the=\r\n mechanism is\nsuccessful. Is there a way to force the program to not need t=\r\nhe\ntransport data?  Any thoughts on why this is crashing?\n\nFinally, I canno=\r\nt find in the help what is meant by the option -id\n&lt;identifier&gt;. I am not u=\r\nsing this option so perhaps that is my problem. \n\nAs a test, I have been tr=\r\nying to convert the mechanisms given by\nlivermore as a test and have been u=\r\nnsuccessful with them all. \nhttp://www-cms.llnl.gov/combustion/combustion2.=\r\nhtml\n\nIf anyone has any advice, I would be most grateful. \n\nBrian-\n\n\n\n\n"}}
