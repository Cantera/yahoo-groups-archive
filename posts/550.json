It was developed before Cantera, and used Chemkin \nfor computations.  To revive it would require porting it to use Cantera \ninstead, which  actually would not be too hard to do.  I don&#39;t mind \ngiving the source code out if you or anyone else want to host a TCC \nsite.  Let me look and see where I put the source code...\n\nDave\n\n\nOn Oct 25, 2004, at 3:45 PM, wick4921 wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; New Cantera user here. Thought I&#39;d toss this in as an FYI:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just (successfully) installed Cantera and Python using the Windows\n&gt; installer on Sourceforge. But my first attempt to define a fluid\n&gt; as &quot;oxygen&quot; met with an error that the &quot;liquidvapor.cti&quot; file could\n&gt; not be found.\n&gt;\n&gt; I did a search and it&#39;s not on my hard drive anywhere. I did manage\n&gt; to acquire the file from the source code and copied it to the\n&gt; appropriate place, but I suspect it was supposed to be in the\n&gt; original install.\n&gt;\n&gt; Secondly, as a former TCC user I wanted to say I miss the site! I\n&gt; realize Cantera is more powerful. But I found the interface of the\n&gt; old site very useful for quick ideas. If it&#39;s offline for good now\n&gt; I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll not be the only one to miss it. That said, is there any\n&gt; plan to make an interface for Cantera that works the way that web\n&gt; site did? If it&#39;s not being maintained any longer, was it ever\n&gt; mirrored anywhere or would you be willing to share the code so it\n&gt; could be run locally? It really was the fastest way I&#39;ve found to do\n&gt; lots of small things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
