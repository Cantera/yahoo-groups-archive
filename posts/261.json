First of all, file nasa.cti only  \n&gt; contains species data, so these definitions need to be imported into\nan  \n&gt; &quot;ideal_gas&quot; entry in another .cti file.  You can write a simple one  \n&gt; like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; ideal_gas(name = &quot;gas&quot;,\n&gt;           elements = &quot;O H C N Ar Al E&quot;,\n&gt;           species = &quot;nasa:all &quot;,\n&gt;            options = [&#39;skip_undeclared_elements&#39;],\n&gt;            initial_state = state(temperature = 300.0, pressure = OneAtm)\n&gt;            )\n&gt; \n&gt; Set the element list to whatever elements you are interested in - the  \n&gt; rest of the species will be skipped. But note that this will pick up  \n&gt; the liquid and solid species in nasa.cti too.  To get rid of these,  \n&gt; edit nasa.cti first.\n&gt; \n&gt; But there are 2 more minor problems.  File nasa.cti has a formatting  \n&gt; error - there is a comma missing on the line before &quot;note&quot; in each  \n&gt; entry. So open it in a text editor and globally replace &quot;note&quot; by  \n&gt; either &quot;, note&quot; or by &quot;# note&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The next problem is that the species import process expects to find an  \n&gt; xml file, not a cti file (this will be fixed someday).  So run program  \n&gt; &#39;cti2ctml&#39; on nasa.cti to generate nasa.xml.  Or just get nasa.xml  \n&gt; here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://rayleigh.cds.caltech.edu/~goodwin/nasa.xml\n&gt; \n&gt; In the modified &#39;demo.cpp&#39; program, use the .cti file with the  \n&gt; ideal_gas entry listed above, and it should work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
