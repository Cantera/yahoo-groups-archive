Actually, I need to c=\r\nompute equilibrium \nderivatives for the equilibrium compositions at each ti=\r\nme step. I am trying to simulate the \nchange in equilibrium compositon as a=\r\n function of time (or crank angle degree) in the \ncombustion chamber of an =\r\ninternal combustion engine, similar to the computation that \nperforms the b=\r\nuilt-in Chemkin reactor for homogeneous combustion. Now I am looking at \nth=\r\ne Cantera demo ignite.m that seems to perform this calculation for a variab=\r\nle volume \nreactor. This might be other way to work it out, but I like your=\r\n idea of computing internal \nenergy as a function of temperature and pressu=\r\nre at each step and using matlab to \ncompute the derivatives myself. Thanks=\r\n for your help.\n\nBest Regards,\nPeter\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;avmo=\r\nkhov&quot; &lt;avmokhov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; It is not completely clea=\r\nr for me what derivatives are you going to \n&gt; calculate. If the mixture  co=\r\nmposition does not change, every \n&gt; thermodynamic function is a function of=\r\n two parameters. Thus you can \n&gt; calculate partial derivative over one para=\r\nmeter when other parameter \n&gt; is kept constant. For example, for the energy=\r\n, partial derivative \n&gt; over temperature at constant volume is Cv. AFAIK ca=\r\nlculating partial \n&gt; derivative of arbitrary thermodynamic parameter is not=\r\n (yet) \n&gt; implemented in Cantera. As a very simple workaround I propose you=\r\n to \n&gt; calculate in Cantera the energy as a function of temperature at fixe=\r\nd \n&gt; pressure and other way round with a reasonable step and then use a \n&gt; =\r\nspreadsheet or Matlab to calculate derivatives. Some fine point is \n&gt; what =\r\ntype of derivatives do you want to calculate =96 frozen or \n&gt; equlibrium? I=\r\nf you want to calculate equilibrium derivatives, than \n&gt; you need to calcul=\r\nate equilibrium composition on every step, while \n&gt; when calculating &quot;froze=\r\nn&quot; derivatives the composition should be kept \n&gt; constant (&quot;frozen).\n&gt; Hope=\r\n that this helps.\n&gt; Anatoli \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Peter Pe=\r\nrez&quot; &lt;plpd00@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wonder if anyone has tried cal=\r\nculating the derivatives of the \n&gt; &gt; thermodynamic properties from Cantera.=\r\n I need to compute \n&gt; derivatives \n&gt; &gt; respect to T and P for the internal =\r\nenergy, i.e., du/dT and du/dp. \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; would appreciate any advice in thi=\r\ns direction.
