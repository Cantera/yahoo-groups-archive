I am trying to link my Fortran program to Cantera.  I built \nand installed Cantera from the source code using Visual C++ .NET, \nthen I found the f77demo project under the source code download \ndirectory:  cantera-1.5.5&#92;tools&#92;templates&#92;f77.  \n\nI have Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6.a installed, which is what I \ncreated my original Fortran program on.  I tried opening and \nbuilding the f77demo project, but the header files (idealgasmix.h, \netc) could not be located.  I fixed this by changing the paths to \nthe header files in the demo_ftnlib.cpp file to \nC:&#92;Cantera&#92;include&#92;cantera&#92;***.h, which is where the Cantera \ninstallation apparently puts them.  This fixed that problem, but now \nI get a bunch of &quot;unresolved external symbol&quot; errors.   \n\nThe readme file included in the f77demo project folder states that I \ncan just open the project file and build it because Compaq Visual \nFortran 6.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 share a common development \nenvironment (Visual Studio).  Is this not the case with Visual \nC++ .NET?  \n\nIt is my understanding that I need to create the .obj file from the \ndemo_ftnlib.cpp and run the included makefile to link that .obj file \nto the one created by the Fortran program.  If this is not what is \nsupposed to happen, please let me know.  Obviously at this point, I \nam having trouble just creating the object file from the \ndemo.ftnlib.cpp file.\n \nAs you can probably tell, my programming experience is very \nlimited.  If someone can point me in the right direction to get the \ndemo program working it would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
