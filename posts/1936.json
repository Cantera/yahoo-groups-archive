As part of this, I&#39;d like to  \ncollect short texts from users (like you!) describing how you use  \nCantera!  Anyone can contribute, and it can be a few sentences or a  \nfew pages, with or without graphics or figures, as you like.  Many of  \nthese will probably go on the new Cantera web site, if you give  \npermission to use your text.  (We do, however, reserve the right to  \nedit for style, length, etc. anything that goes on the web site.)  We  \nwill also provide a repository where you can deposited and share your  \noriginal unedited text, if you like.)\n\nWe&#39;re interested in hearing from the full range of the user  \ncommunity, from students using it in classes, to the instructors of  \nthose classes, all the way up to &quot;power users&quot; incorporating Cantera  \ninto their very big supercomputer codes.\n\nAnd of course we want to hear from you in the middle too, who use it  \nto do short equilibrium calculations, or run flat flame simulations,  \nfor example.\n\nHope to hear from many of you\t! The easiest way to send it may be be  \nas an email attachment to a message to &quot;dgg@...&quot;.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
