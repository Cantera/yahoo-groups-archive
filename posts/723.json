If your transport database is an \nMS-DOS text file and you try use it with ck2cti on a unix or linux \nsystem, it will fail, and it will likely fail also if you use a \nunix-created transport database on an MS-DOS / Windows system.  The \nproblem is that MS-DOS uses two non-printing characters to denote the \nend of a line (CR LF) and unix uses only one (LF).  So a DOS text file \nwhen read on a unix system appears to have extra CR characters, and \nthis confuses ck2cti. This has been fixed in version 1.6.0, which is \nstill in development and hasn&#39;t been released, but is available through \nCVS. Otherwise, convert your transport database to have the correct \nline endings for text files on your system.  Often this can be done \njust be opening it in MS Word, and saving it as a text file.\n\nOn Feb 28, 2005, at 10:47 PM, moviesany wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am wondering what went wrong when I tried to use ck2cti to convert\n&gt; n-Heptane, reduced mechanism from:\n&gt; http://www-cms.llnl.gov/combustion/combustion2.html.\n&gt; The convertor appers to be usig CPU but it did not produced any output\n&gt; file in about 10 min.
