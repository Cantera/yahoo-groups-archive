The naive way to do this is as\nfollows:\n\n   &gt;&gt; g = air;\n   &gt;&gt; h = g;\n  \nNow, this doesn&#39;t actually work, as the following shows:\n\n   &gt;&gt; temperature(g)\n   300\n\n   &gt;&gt; set(h,&#39;T&#39;,600);\n   &gt;&gt; temperature(h)\n   600\n\n   &gt;&gt; temperature(g)\n   600\n\nWhat&#39;s happening, as I understand it, is that h and g are stored as\npointers, and so &quot;h = g&quot; means creating a new pointer h that points\nto the same mixture as g.  And so there still is only one gas mixture\nextant.  Is this understanding correct?\n\nAnd the real question -- is there a built-in way of creating an h\nthat is in fact a _separate_ copy of g?  Or do I have to do this\nmanually, by defining a &quot;copy_mixture&quot; function from scratch that\ncreates a &quot;blank&quot; h and then sets all the fractions and variables to\nequal those of g?  I looked through the Solution methods, and didn&#39;t\nsee anything that appeared to be an obvious answer.\n\nIf such a built-in function doesn&#39;t currently exist in Cantera, I&#39;d\nlike to request it as a feature on future releases.\n\nThanks,\n- Brooks\n\n\n\n"}}
