Thought I&#39;d toss this in as an FYI:\n\nI just (successfully) installed Cantera and Python using the Windows \ninstaller on Sourceforge. But my first attempt to define a fluid \nas &quot;oxygen&quot; met with an error that the &quot;liquidvapor.cti&quot; file could \nnot be found.\n\nI did a search and it&#39;s not on my hard drive anywhere. I did manage \nto acquire the file from the source code and copied it to the \nappropriate place, but I suspect it was supposed to be in the \noriginal install.\n\nSecondly, as a former TCC user I wanted to say I miss the site! I \nrealize Cantera is more powerful. But I found the interface of the \nold site very useful for quick ideas. If it&#39;s offline for good now \nI&#39;m sure I&#39;ll not be the only one to miss it. That said, is there any \nplan to make an interface for Cantera that works the way that web \nsite did? If it&#39;s not being maintained any longer, was it ever \nmirrored anywhere or would you be willing to share the code so it \ncould be run locally? It really was the fastest way I&#39;ve found to do \nlots of small things.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
