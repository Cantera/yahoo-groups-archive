If you want to create an ideal gas mixture \nusing these species, you can do so by adding and &quot;ideal_gas&quot; entry to \nthe file. See how this is done in file gri30.cti, for example.\n\nIf file nasa.cti contained only gaseous species, you could simply \nimport all of them into your gas mixture with an entry like this, which \ncould be in some other cti file.\n\nideal_gas(name = &quot;gas&quot;,\n                    elements = &quot;H C O N Ar&quot;,\n                    species = &quot;nasa: all&quot;,\n                    options  = &quot;skip_undeclared_elements&quot;)\n\nThis will create a gas mixture of all species in nasa.cti that contain \nonly the elements H, C, O, N, and/or Ar.  Unfortunately nasa.cti \ncontains condensed-phase species too, like H2O(L) and H2O(S).  So if \nyou want to do this, you would need to first create an edited version \nof nasa.cti that contains only the gaseous species. Alternatively, you \ncan just list explicitly every species you want to include, as is done \nin gri30.cti.\n\nAs far as the temperature problem -- if you are using gri30.cti, then \nthe valid temperature range for the gas mixture is set by the species \nwith the highest minimum temperature, and the one with the lowest \nmaximum temperature.  Even species that have zero mole fraction or \nextremely small mole fraction are considered when determining the valid \ntemperature range.  In gri30.cti, the species CH3O has a maximum \ntemperature of 3000 K.  If you want to do computations at higher \ntemperature, you could remove this species from the phase (edit \ngri30.cti, or create a copy with a different file name) if it is not \nimportant for what you are computing.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Jun 7, 2005, at 11:00 AM, csmnofbobs wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Dave,\n&gt; Sorry to keep bothering you with these simple questions.  I can not\n&gt; figure out how to use data from nasa.cti without pasting the data I\n&gt; want into a new cti file.  Another student here using Cantera told me\n&gt; that in the equil demo, all he had to do was replace gri30.cti with\n&gt; nasa.cti and it worked fine.  When I try this, I get the following\n&gt; error:\n&gt;\n&gt; Procedure: xml_findByName\n&gt; Error:   name phase not found\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; XML_Node.findByName at 4\n&gt; index = ctmethods(10, 9, root.id, name);\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; Solution.Solution at 32\n&gt;   node = findByName(doc,&#39;phase&#39;);\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; IdealGasMix at 39\n&gt;        s = Solution(a);\n&gt;\n&gt; Error in ==&gt; equiltest at 12\n&gt;    gas = IdealGasMix(&#39;nasa.cti&#39;);\n&gt;\n&gt; I made sure that nasa.cti and gri30.cti are in the same directory,\n&gt; and I checked to make sure that the species I am using have entries\n&gt; in nasa.cti.  What could be the problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you very much for your help,\n&gt; Jeff Miller\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
