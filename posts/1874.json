What I meant (not sure \nwhat a=\r\n &quot;functor&quot; is) is to be able to set the mole fractions by using \nvariables =\r\ninstead of the string in the set command. For example, I \nwould like to do =\r\nsomething like this:\n\nmole_CH4 =3D 1.0\nmole_O2 =3D 1/phi*(1+y/4.0))  # phi =\r\nand y are computed in my code.\nmole_N2 =3D (1/phi*(1+y/4.0)*(Xn2/Xo2))  # X=\r\nn2, Xo2 are mole fractions.\n\nThen set the mole fractions with something lik=\r\ne this:\ngas.set(T=3D900.0,P=3D1.0e5,X=3D&#39;CH4:mole_CH4,O2:mole_O2,N2:mole_N2=\r\n&#39;)\n\nRight now, I just compute the new stoichiometry (according to my phi) \n=\r\nand then modify the value in the set command. This is not a big deal, \nbut =\r\nit takes some time when you want to do the calculation for many \nconditions=\r\n. Anatoli&#39;s approach is a very good idea. However, it still \nrequires the m=\r\nole fractions to be given as strings, which do not \nsupport arithmetic oper=\r\nations. Thank you both again for your interest \nand help.
