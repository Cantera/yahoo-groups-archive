I =\r\ninstalled python, numpy and then ran the cantera\nself installer .msi file a=\r\nnd then ran the .exe cantera file from the\ncantera folder. I am able to run=\r\n matlab demos but am unable to run the\nC++ version. Do i need to build cant=\r\nera like some of the docs suggest\nusing VC++ .NET. Also is the same build p=\r\nossible using Visual Studio\n6? One other question is on using wall velocity=\r\n for the reactor. I am\nunable to get this to work in matlab (specify the ve=\r\nlocity as a\nfourier function). Does anybody know any sample code for this. =\r\nWould\nbe of immense help. Thanks in advance, shyam.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
