The tar file was\ncopied in /usr/local and produced a cantera directory after &quot;tar\nzxvf&quot;. \nI commented lines associated with the preparation of Fortran, MathLab\nand Python interfaces (the configure file).CANTERA_ROOT and PATH were\nfixed to /usr/local/cantera and $CANTERA_ROOT/bin, respectively.\nI used gcc/g++ 3.3.2 which includes g77. Line F77 in configure was\nuncommented and its f77 was replaced by gcc. Morevover line containing\nF90 was commented.\n\n./ configure, make and make install worked.\n\nThe &quot;make&quot; in examples/cxx ended with:\n\ng++ -o ./cxx_examples examples.o kinetics_examples1.o ...\n/usr/local/cantera/build/lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lre\ncipes.a(simplx.o)(text+0x4a\n): in function &lt;&lt;simplx_&gt;&gt;: undefined reference to `s_pass`\n\nThe same was reproduced several times and related to:\nlibctlapack\nlibctmath\nlictblas\n\nAs a consequence cxx_examples was not generated.\n\nI would be very grateful for any help. Thank in advance.\n\nThierry Lepoint, Prof. at the Institut Meurice (Belgium)\n\n\n"}}
