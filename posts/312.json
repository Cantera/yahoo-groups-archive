The space shouldn&#39;t \nbe required, but it is at present. I always punctuate these strings \nwith a space by habit, and so didn&#39;t catch this problem with the \ncomposition string parser.\n\nIf anyone wants to look into this problem and recommend a fix, the \nparsing is done by function &#39;parseCompString&#39; in file \n&#39;stringUtils.cpp&#39;.\n\nDave\n\n\n\nOn Mar 12, 2004, at 3:37 PM, brooksmoses1 wrote:\n\n&gt; [This has been crossposted to the Sourceforge bug tracker]\n&gt;\n&gt; It appears that the Cantera-Matlab setMassFractions function doesn&#39;t\n&gt; work right if I use a string such as &#39;H2:0.5, O2:0.5&#39; as the mass\n&gt; fraction specification.

Also, sometimes adding space in the mass-fraction\n&gt; string (e.g., &#39;H2:0.5, H:0.5&#39;) will change the results.\n&gt;\n&gt; All of my tests have been on version 1.4; however, a colleague of mine\n&gt; who is using 1.5.3 confirmed that this problem is reproducable on his\n&gt; machine.  Further, my colleague was reproducing the results with\n&gt; commands such as &quot;set(GAS_OBJECT,&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;N2:79,O2:21,CH4:6&#39;,&#39;T&#39;,300,&#39;P&#39;,\n&gt; oneatm)&quot;, which implies that the problem is somewhere deep in the\n&gt; Cantera code rather than in the Matlab files.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do note that the setMassFractions function seems to work correctly\n&gt; if the mass fractions are specified as a vector; thus, the following\n&gt; is what I&#39;ve been using as a workaround in functions where I want to\n&gt; specify the mass fractions as a string:\n&gt;\n&gt;   setMoleFractions(GAS_OBJECT,Y);\n&gt;   setMassFractions(GAS_OBJECT,MoleFractions(GAS_OBJECT));\n&gt;\n&gt; - Brooks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
