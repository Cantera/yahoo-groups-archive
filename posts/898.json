So you should certainly be using \nMatlab 7\n&gt; if you&#39;re going to use Cantera 1.6.0.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) You can use much of Cantera without python, but all of your \nthermo\n&gt; input needs to come from .xml files (the conversion from .cti \nto .xml\n&gt; is the python-dependent step).  I think that the 1.6.0 installer \ncomes\n&gt; with a few input files already converted, but if not, I can send \nyou a\n&gt; few examples.  They should be in your C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Common\n&gt; Files&#92;Cantera&#92;Data directory.  With a fresh install of 1.6.0, you\n&gt; should be able to type:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; G = idealGasMix(&#39;gri30.xml&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; at the matlab prompt and get things to work from there.  Note that \nthe\n&gt; tutorials and demos will NOT work because they use the\n&gt; Python-dependent command:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; G = idealGasMix(&#39;gri30.cti&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Python is very simple to install, and it&#39;s free, so don&#39;t be \nafraid\n&gt; to give that a try to get Cantera&#39;s full functionality.  There are \na\n&gt; couple of steps involved in setting the path correctly in your\n&gt; operating system, but they&#39;re pretty well documented in various\n&gt; versions of the Cantera installation instructions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Luck!\n&gt; \n&gt; -A.J.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pesentib_fpms&quot; \n&lt;Barbara.Pesenti@f...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a very new user of the Cantera user&#39;s Group but I currently \nuse \n&gt; &gt; a very old version of the Matlab files series of Cantera (the\n&gt; zipped \n&gt; &gt; file was cantera-mlab-10.zip, downloaded in 2002).  I used it \nthe \n&gt; &gt; last time with Matlab 6, one year ago...and it still worked \n&gt; &gt; properly.  I try to re-use it but I always get the following \nerror \n&gt; &gt; message:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unable to load mex file: C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;Barbara \n&gt; &gt; Pesenti&#92;Mes documents&#92;Utils&#92;Utilitaires \n&gt; &gt; Pphys&#92;Cantera&#92;Cantera_Matlab&#92;cantera-mlab-10\n&gt; &gt; &#92;cantera&#92;@Phase&#92;private&#92;newphase.dll.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I tried to change the path, to move the files, to work in the \n&gt; &gt; directory where the files are,... but noting works.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone still use this old version somewhere and can advise \nme?\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If not, I&#39;d like to know how to use the latest release of Cantera\n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; Matlab.  I have downloaded and installed the new toolbox in \n&gt; &gt; &#92;Cantera&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera, but it appearently needs Python \nto \n&gt; &gt; run inside Matlab.  Python was not necessary with the older \nversion \n&gt; &gt; of the matlab routines and I am therefore a little bit confused\n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; the new release (I&#39;m really not familiar with Python).  Could \nyou \n&gt; &gt; please tell me how I should proceed to make the latest Cantera \n&gt; &gt; Toolbox run into Matlab (6 or 7)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance to anyone who can help,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Barbara\n\n\n\n"}}
