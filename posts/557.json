You&#39;ll have to watch your \npeak temperatures closely to make sure you stay in range of your \nspecies definitions (constant V combustion gets hot since no work is \nperformed expanding the products).\n\nG = gri30;\nset(G,&#39;X&#39;,&#39;H2:1,O2:2,N2:7.52&#39;,&#39;T&#39;,300,&#39;P&#39;,101325)\nequilibrate(G,&#39;UV&#39;)\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in a flame propagating through a pre-mixed \ngasoline-fuel mixture in an engine cylinder you&#39;ll want something a \nbit more complex than this. Bill Reynold&#39;s ICE code (or any number of \nothers) would be a good place to start for that. But I hope this \ngives you a staring point. \n\nGood luck.\nChad\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kochzg&quot; &lt;kochzg@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi \n&gt; I need example (Cantera - Phyton) to calculate combustion procces \nin \n&gt; constant volume chamber.\n&gt; (my email: kochzg@g...)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank\n&gt; \n&gt; Kochzg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
