The unmodified CVODE code itself is in directory ext/cvode, \nand the C++ wrapper for it class &#39;CVodeInt&#39;, declared in \nCantera/src/CVode.h. There is also a Cantera C++ wrapper for DASPK, \nbut it is not used for anything within Cantera right now.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 1: Which ODE/DAE solver (DASSC, DVODE and DASPK) was adopted by \n&gt; cantera for the core chemical kinetical problem dy/dt=F(y,t)? In \n&gt; which C++ file (please give the file name) the solver was called?\n&gt; \n\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, Cantera and Chemkin produce virtually \nidentical results for zero-D kinetics. For example, the adiabatic \ncombustion example I include in the MATLAB version (that use MATLAB \nintegrators rather than CVODE) produces a final temperature that \nagrees to within 0.01 K with both the value computed by SENKIN using \nthe DASAC integrator, and by C++ Cantera using CVODE. The species and \ntemperature profiles are in good agreement at all times. I only \ncompared the results to those of a rather old version of Chemkin II, \nbut I assume they are the same with Chemkin III.\n  \n\n\n&gt; 2: Did you compare the results coming out from cantera with those \n&gt; from CHEMKIN III? Or what do you think to use different ODE solvers?\n&gt; Can we expect the same y vs. t? Indeed when I used MATLAB&#39;s ODE15S \nto \n&gt; solve the same problem shown in SENKIN as a example,(20 reaction, 9 \n&gt; species), I got silent different y vs. t?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3: Since k=k(t,T) and T=T(t), it is difficult to solve large sparse \n&gt; DAEs. In my own opinion, (^-^), it is not well known that CHEMKIN \nIII \n&gt; adopt the method of infinite difference to divide the time range to \n&gt; custom designed number of small ranges and assume the same \n&gt; temperature within one small time range and use the previous \n&gt; calulated T to compute k in next range. So the DAEs were changed to \n&gt; ODE and easier to be solved by DASSC. Of course, it is not a \nprefect \n&gt; method. Can you tell us something about how to handle this kind of \n&gt; problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you!\n&gt; \n&gt; Pingping\n\n\n"}}
