You are right\n&gt; there is some problems with my Fortran librairies.\n&gt; I followed your suggestion. However I identified that I cannot used\n&gt; g77 directly on my Gentoo workstation (gcc -x f77 works fine but I\n&gt; have still the same problem in the &quot;make&quot; associated with\n&gt; examples/cxx). The g77 command does not exist on my gentoos and I have\n&gt; no means to &quot;emerge&quot; it. In constrast, on a mandrake 9.1, I have no\n&gt; problem with cantera.\n&gt; I am continuing and inform the list in case of success with\n&gt; g77/gentoo/cantera.\n&gt; \n&gt; My best wishes,\n&gt; Thierry\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it is a Fortran problem.  Probably it is not finding some  \n&gt; &gt; Fortran library. Maybe try running the default &#39;configure&#39; script  \n&gt; &gt; without modifications first, since it comes set up to build on linux  \n&gt; &gt; with g++, g77, etc.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On May 11, 2004, at 3:42 PM, tlepo2000 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Collegues,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The present comment deals with the install of cantera-1.5 (or\n-1.5.2)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on a Gentoo Linux workstation (stable packages). The tar file was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; copied in /usr/local and produced a cantera directory after &quot;tar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; zxvf&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I commented lines associated with the preparation of Fortran,\nMathLab\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Python interfaces (the configure file).CANTERA_ROOT and PATH\nwere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fixed to /usr/local/cantera and $CANTERA_ROOT/bin, respectively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I used gcc/g++ 3.3.2 which includes g77. Line F77 in configure was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; uncommented and its f77 was replaced by gcc. Morevover line\ncontaining\n&gt; &gt; &gt; F90 was commented.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ./ configure, make and make install worked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The &quot;make&quot; in examples/cxx ended with:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; g++ -o ./cxx_examples examples.o kinetics_examples1.o ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /usr/local/cantera/build/lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lre\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cipes.a(simplx.o)(text+0x4a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ): in function &lt;&lt;simplx_&gt;&gt;: undefined reference to `s_pass`\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The same was reproduced several times and related to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; libctlapack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; libctmath\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lictblas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a consequence cxx_examples was not generated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be very grateful for any help.
