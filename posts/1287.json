When I do this, the \ninitial guess =\r\nstates that mass flux is zero, velocity profile is zero, \nall species profi=\r\nles are zero, and that temperature ranges from -.5 \nto .5 K!  Does anyone e=\r\nlse have this issue?  Is this the actual guess \nthat the simulation uses, o=\r\nr is this just printed before the actual \nguess is initialized?  I suspect =\r\nthe latter since it will sometimes \nstill arrive at a sensible solution.  I=\r\n know that the initial guess can \nbe explicitly entered by modifying FreeFl=\r\name.py, but it appears that I \nwould also need to recompile FreeFlame.pyc a=\r\nnd FreeFlame.pyo.  How is \nthis done?  \nThanks in advance for advice anyone=\r\n has to offer.\nJeff\n\n\n\n\n"}}
