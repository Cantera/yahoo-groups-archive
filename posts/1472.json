I was able to get\nthe same\nw=\r\norking in python using a code that dr.goodwin had posted on this group. \n  =\r\nOne thing i noticed is that there is no setVelocity.m file in my\ninstallati=\r\non in the C:&#92;Cantera&#92;MATLAB&#92;toolbox&#92;cantera&#92;@Wall. I think\nthere should be =\r\na file so that in matlab i can call this function to\nset the piston velocit=\r\ny.
