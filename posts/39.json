I would like to help you, by offering the use of one or\nmore (graduate) students here to help develop process models for waste to\nenergy gasification reactors. The initial work would be all equilibrium.\nPlease let me know how best to proceed. Do you have any sponsored research\nthat could help support student stipends? If not, may be I could get one of\nmy two sponsors to help. Please let me know how this could be done, directly\nor indirectly. Is Cantera an official Caltech project, or just a development\nproject with you as the sole proprietor?\n\nRegards, Dr. Colin Hackett \tPrincipal Investigator - Waste to Energy\nProjects\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----\nColin Hackett, Ph.D., P.E. \t\t| E-mail: colin@...\nManager, Renewable Energy Programs\t| Tel: 909-781-5668\nCollege of Engineering\t\t\t| Fax: 909-781-5790\nCenter for Environmental \t\t| UC Riverside  CE-CERT  022\nResearch and Technology\t\t\t| Riverside, CA 92521-0434\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: dggoodwin [mailto:dgoodwin@...]\nSent: Friday, February 15, 2002 9:00 AM\nTo: cantera@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [cantera] progress report\n\n\n\nSometimes I wonder what I&#39;ve gotten myself into with Cantera... it\nturns out (big surprise) that developing a large software project is\nA Big Job. Particularly when one has a day job...\n\nAnyway, significant progress is being made, although it may not seem\nlike it (to anyone but me). In particular, the first really-useful\nCantera application is almost ready - a one dimensional reacting-flow\napplication, that can be used to simulate:\n\n- 1D laminar flames\n- counterflow flames\n- stagnation-point flows with surface chemistry (CVD, catalysis, etc.)\n\nI expect it will be ready to ship in a couple of weeks... stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncantera-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
