I am wondering what the diag[] array is for.  \nIt seems that it is zero for algebraic constraints and 1 for non-\nalgebraic?  Numerically, what does it do.  \n\nI&#39;m trying to figure out whether the following should have diag[index\n(c_offset_U,j)] set to 1 or 0.\n\nelse if(j==jfixed){\n   rsd[index(c_offset_U,j)] = T(x,j)-Tfixed;\n\n\nThanks,\n\nKarl\n\n\n\n\n"}}
