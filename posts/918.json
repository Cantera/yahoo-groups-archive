I am\ntrying to model charge-transfer reactions at the TPB in an\nanode-supported SOFC.  However, after reading the pdf on creating cti\nfiles, I am having trouble entering code for these reactions that\ncantera/python is able to translate.  For example, here is one\nreaction I have attempted to enter:\n\n\n#  Reaction 0004\ncharge_transfer_reaction( &quot;H_c(S) + OH_e(S) = NI(S) + H2O_e(S) +\ne_Ni&quot;,\n\t\t[5e15, 0, (90, &#39;kJ/mol&#39;)]\n\t)\n\nAre there other parameters that need to be entered?  As I remember,\nthe Beta value is optional, with a default of 0.5.  I also remember\nyou mentioning that the potentials of the different phases can be\nspecified; does this need to be done in the cti file, or can it be\ndone through the matlab interface?  (I hope it is the latter).  \n\nAnyway, if I simply change the reaction type to &quot;surface_reaction,&quot;\nmy xml is created just fine, but obviously, these rates wouldn&#39;t\naccurately represent the kinetics I am attempting to simulate.\n\nMany thanks,\nSteven DeCaluwe\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
