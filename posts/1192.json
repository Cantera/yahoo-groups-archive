I am going down this route to decrease our \n&gt; reliance on Chemkin, specifically the Aurora code in Chemkin. So \n&gt; my question, does anyone know where to find, or have any MATLAB \n&gt; reactor code for a constant temperature and pressure situation? \n&gt; Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, Eric ------------------------ Yahoo!
