These fake species are given the thermodynamic properties of Argon,\njust to get started.\n\nFictitious names for these species often result in gas objects that\nhave the\nmass of real elements, presumably because of name similarity. Essentially,\nthe fake names do not work.\n\nIs there an easy way to define new elements or species of arbitrary\nmass in\nCantera for MATLAB?\n\nThanks for any help you can provide.\n\nRohit\n\n\n"}}
