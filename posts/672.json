Th=\r\ne \nproblem of &quot;negative mole fraction for CH4&quot; still appears for the \nfollo=\r\nwing input state:\n      Temperature=3D820 K\n      Pressure=3D1e5 Pa\n      M=\r\nole fraction of CH4=3D0.25\n      Mole fraction of H2O(gas)=3D0.75 \nusing th=\r\ne command equilibrate(gas, &#39;TP&#39;). &quot;gas&quot; is an ideal gas \nmixture which allo=\r\nws the presence of the following gases:\n      CH4, CO, CO2, H2, H2O, N2, O2=\r\n\nThe problem doesn&#39;t appear every time I run the simulation but for \nmore t=\r\nhan 50% of the runs. I&#39;ve also done some sensitivity analysis. \nThe problem=\r\n occurs between temperatures of approx. 770 K and 850 K and \npressures of a=\r\npprox. 1e5 Pa and 3e5 Pa. The mole fractions don&#39;t seem \nto have any influe=\r\nnce on the occurrence of the problem. I hope this \ninformation is useful fo=\r\nr isolating the problem.\n\nBj=F6rn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In cantera@yahoogroups.com, Dav=\r\nid Goodwin &lt;dgoodwin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Bjorn -\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not simply a negat=\r\nive mole fraction. &quot;-1.#IND&quot; means it is \n&gt; indeterminate, which likely mea=\r\nns it divided by zero somewhere. \nUsually \n&gt; this means there is something =\r\nwrong with the input state.  If you \ncan \n&gt; tell me the precise conditions =\r\nthat produce this, I can see what the \n&gt; problem is.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 13, 2005, =\r\nat 1:25 AM, bjoern_eide wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using =\r\nCantera in combination with Matlab/Simulink doing \ndynamic\n&gt; &gt; calculations=\r\n of a steam reforming process of methane. The Cantera\n&gt; &gt; calculation is pa=\r\nrt of a differential equation used to determine \nthe\n&gt; &gt; reactor temperatur=\r\ne via the energy balance. The Cantera part \nitself\n&gt; &gt; only involves the ca=\r\nlculation of chemical equilibrium\n&gt; &gt; using &quot;equilibrate(gas, &#39;TP&#39;)&quot; and th=\r\ne calculation of the heat of\n&gt; &gt; reaction.
